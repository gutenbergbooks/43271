<p>Warton says that the poem was "first advertised in the Spectator, No. 65,

Lewis, the publisher, was a Roman Catholic, and an old schoolfellow of the

<p>London: Printed for <span class="smcap">W. Lewis</span>, in Russel-Street, Covent Garden, 1713.</p>

<p>Though the date on the title page is 1713, Isaac Reed states that the second
edition was advertised in the Spectator on November 22, 1712. It was a
common practice to substitute the date of the coming, for that of the expiring,
year. A third and fourth edition in a smaller type and size came out
in 1713. In 1714, the poem was appended to the second edition of Lintot's
Miscellanies, by some arrangement with Lewis, whose name appears upon the
title page of that particular edition of the Miscellanies as joint publisher. On
July 17, 1716, Lintot purchased the remainder of the copyright for £15, preparatory
to inserting the piece in the quarto of 1717. He brought out a sixth
octavo edition of the essay in 1719, and a seventh in 1722, and reprinted the
poem in each of the four editions of his Miscellanies which were published
between 1720 and 1732.</p>

<p class="center">Written in the year 1709. With the Commentary and Notes of
<span class="smcap">W. Warburton</span>, A.M. 4to.</p>

<p class="space-below">The Essay on Criticism has no date, but on the title page of the "Essay on
Man," which appeared in the same volume is, "London: Printed by <span class="smcap">W.
Bowyer</span> for <span class="smcap">M. Cooper</span>, at the Globe in Pater-Noster Row. 1743." Pope,
writing to Warburton on October 7, 1743, says, "I have given Bowyer your
comment on the Essay on Criticism this week, and he shall lose no time with
the rest." On Jan. 12, 1744, he tells his commentator that the publication
had been delayed by the advice of Bowyer, and on Feb. 21, he writes word
that he shall keep it back till Warburton goes to town. There is no doubt
that the edition was printed in 1743, and published in 1744.
</p>

<p>In the year 1709 was written the Essay on Criticism, a work
which displays such extent of comprehension, such nicety of distinction,
such acquaintance with mankind, and such knowledge both of
ancient and modern learning, as are not often attained by the maturest
age and longest experience. It was published about two years
afterwards, and being praised by Addison in the Spectator, with
sufficient liberality, met with so much favour as enraged Dennis,
"who," he says, "found himself attacked without any manner of
provocation on his side, and attacked in his person, instead of his
writings, by one who was wholly a stranger to him, at a time when
all the world knew he was persecuted by fortune; and not only saw
that this was attempted in a clandestine manner, with the utmost
falsehood and calumny, but found that all this was done by a little
affected hypocrite, who had nothing in his mouth at the same time
but truth, candour, friendship, goodnature, humanity, and magnanimity."
How the attack was clandestine is not easily perceived, nor
how his person is depreciated; but he seems to have known something
of Pope's character, in whom may be discovered an appetite to
talk too frequently of his own virtues. Thus began the hostility
between Pope and Dennis, which, though it was suspended for a
short time, never was appeased. Pope seems, at first, to have attacked
him wantonly; but though he always professed to despise
him, he discovers, by mentioning him very often, that he felt his
force or his venom.</p>

<p>Of this Essay Pope declared that he did not expect the sale to be
quick, because "not one gentleman in sixty, even of liberal education,
could understand it." The gentlemen and the education of that
time seem to have been of a lower character than they are of this.
He mentioned a thousand copies as a numerous impression. Dennis
was not his only censurer. The zealous papists thought the monks
treated with too much contempt, and Erasmus too studiously praised;
but to these objections he had not much regard. The Essay has been
translated into French by Hamilton, author of the Comte de Grammont,
whose version was never printed; by Robotham, secretary to
the king for Hanover, and by Resnel; and commented by Dr. Warburton,
who has discovered in it such order and connection as was
not perceived by Addison, nor, as is said, intended by the author.
Almost every poem consisting of precepts is so far arbitrary and
immethodical, that many of the paragraphs may change places with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
no apparent inconvenience; for of two or more positions, depending
upon some remote and general principle, there is seldom any cogent
reason why one should precede the other. But for the order in
which they stand, whatever it be, a little ingenuity may easily give a
reason. "It is possible," says Hooker, "that, by long circumduction
from any one truth, all truth may be inferred." Of all homogeneous
truths, at least of all truths respecting the same general end,
in whatever series they may be produced, a concatenation by intermediate
ideas may be formed such as, when it is once shown, shall
appear natural; but if this order be reversed, another mode of
connection equally specious may be found or made. Aristotle is
praised for naming fortitude first of the cardinal virtues, as that
without which no other virtue can steadily be practised; but he
might with equal propriety have placed prudence and justice before
it, since without prudence fortitude is mad, without justice it is
mischievous. As the end of method is perspicuity, that series is
sufficiently regular that avoids obscurity, and where there is no
obscurity, it will not be difficult to discover method.</p>

<p>The Essay on Criticism is one of Pope's greatest works, and if he
had written nothing else, would have placed him among the first
critics and the first poets, as it exhibits every mode of excellence
that can embellish or dignify didactic composition&mdash;selection of matter,
novelty of arrangement, justness of precept, splendour of illustration,
and propriety of digression. I know not whether it be
pleasing to consider that he produced this piece at twenty, and never
afterwards excelled it. He that delights himself with observing that
such powers may be soon attained, cannot but grieve to think that
life was ever after at a stand. To mention the particular beauties of
the essay, would be unprofitably tedious; but I cannot forbear to
observe that the comparison of a student's progress in the sciences
with the journey of a traveller in the Alps, is perhaps the best that
English poetry can show. A simile, to be perfect, must both illustrate
and ennoble the subject; must show it to the understanding in
a clearer view, and display it to the fancy with greater dignity; but
either of these qualities may be sufficient to recommend it. In
didactic poetry, of which the great purpose is instruction, a simile
may be praised which illustrates though it does not ennoble; in
heroics that may be admitted which ennobles, though it does not
illustrate. That it may be complete, it is required to exhibit, independently
of its references, a pleasing image; for a simile is said
to be a short episode. To this antiquity was so attentive, that
circumstances were sometimes added which, having no parallels,
served only to fill the imagination, and produced what Perrault
ludicrously called "comparisons with a long tail." In their similes
the greatest writers have sometimes failed. The ship race compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with the chariot race, is neither illustrated nor aggrandised; land
and water make all the difference. When Apollo, running after
Daphne, is likened to a greyhound chasing a hare, there is nothing
gained; the ideas of pursuit and flight are too plain to be made
plainer, and a god and the daughter of a god, are not represented
much to their advantage by a hare and a dog. The simile of the
Alps has no useless parts, yet affords a striking picture by itself;
it makes the foregoing position better understood, and enables it to
take faster hold on the attention; it assists the apprehension, and
elevates the fancy.</p>

<p>Let me likewise dwell a little on the celebrated paragraph in
which it is directed that the sound should seem an echo to the
sense,&mdash;a precept which Pope is allowed to have observed beyond
any other English poet. This notion of representative metre, and
the desire of discovering frequent adaptations of the sound to the
sense, have produced, in my opinion, many wild conceits and
imaginary beauties. All that can furnish this representation are the
sounds of the words considered singly, and the time in which they
are pronounced. Every language has some words framed to exhibit
the noises which they express, as <i>thump</i>, <i>rattle</i>, <i>growl</i>, <i>hiss</i>. These,
however, are but few, and the poet cannot make them more, nor
can they be of any use but when sound is to be mentioned. The
time of pronunciation was in the dactylic measures of the learned
languages capable of considerable variety; but that variety could be
accommodated only to motion or duration, and different degrees of
motion were perhaps expressed by verses rapid or slow, without
much attention of the writer, when the image had full possession
of his fancy; but our language having little flexibility, our verses
can differ very little in their cadence. The fancied resemblances,
I fear, arise sometimes merely from the ambiguity of words; there
is supposed to be some relation between a <i>soft</i> line and a <i>soft</i>
couch, or between <i>hard</i> syllables and <i>hard</i> fortune. Motion, however,
may be in some sort exemplified, and yet it may be suspected
that in such resemblances the mind often governs the
idea, and the sounds are estimated by their meaning. One of
their most successful attempts has been to describe the labour of
Sisyphus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With many a weary step, and many a groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge round stone, resulting with a bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thunders impetuous down, and smokes along the ground.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Who does not perceive the stone to move slowly upward, and roll
violently back? But set the same numbers to another sense:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While many a merry tale, and many a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheered the rough road, we wished the rough road long;<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></div></div>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rough road then, returning in a round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocked our impatient steps, for all was fairy ground.<br />
</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We have surely now lost much of the delay, and much of the
rapidity. But to show how little the greatest master of numbers
can fix the principles of representative harmony, it will be sufficient
to remark that the poet who tells us that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The line too labours, and the words move slow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>when he had enjoyed for about thirty years the praise of Camilla's
lightness of foot, he tried another experiment upon <i>sound</i>
and <i>time</i>, and produced this memorable triplet:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The varying verse, the full resounding line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long majestic march, and energy divine.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>



<p>Here are the swiftness of the rapid race, and the march of slow-paced
majesty, exhibited by the same poet in the same sequence of
syllables, except that the exact prosodist will find the line of swiftness
by one time longer than that of tardiness. Beauties of this
kind are commonly fancied, and when real are technical and nugatory,
not to be rejected, and not to be solicited.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>The Essay on Criticism is a poem of that species for which our
author's genius was particularly turned,&mdash;the didactic and moral. It
is therefore, as might be expected, a master-piece in its kind. I
have been sometimes inclined to think that the praises Addison has
bestowed on it were a little partial and invidious. "The observations,"
says he, "follow one another like those in Horace's Art of
Poetry, without that methodical regularity which would have been
requisite in a prose writer." It is, however, certain that the poem
before us is by no means destitute of a just integrity, and a lucid
order.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Each of the precepts and remarks naturally introduce the
succeeding ones, so as to form an entire whole. The Spectator adds,
"The observations in this Essay are <i>some</i> of them <i>uncommon</i>."
There is, I fear, a small mixture of ill-nature in these words; for this
Essay, though on a beaten subject, abounds in many new remarks
and original rules, as well as in many happy and beautiful illustrations
and applications of the old ones. We are, indeed, amazed to
find such a knowledge of the world, such a maturity of judgment,
and such a penetration into human nature, as are here displayed, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
so very young a writer as was Pope when he produced this Essay, for
he was not twenty years old. Correctness and a just taste are
usually not attained but by long practice and experience in any art;
but a clear head and strong sense were the characteristical qualities
of our author, and every man soonest displays his radical excellences.
If his predominant talent be warmth and vigour of imagination it
will break out in fanciful and luxuriant descriptions, the colouring
of which will perhaps be too rich and glowing. If his chief force
lies in the understanding rather than in the imagination, it will soon
appear by solid and manly observations on life or learning, expressed
in a more chaste and subdued style. The former will frequently be
hurried into obscurity or turgidity, and a false grandeur of diction;
the latter will seldom hazard a figure whose usage is not already
established, or an image beyond common life; will always be perspicuous
if not elevated; will never disgust if not transport his
readers; will avoid the grosser faults if not arrive at the greater
beauties of composition. When we consider the just taste, the
strong sense, the knowledge of men, books, and opinions that are so
predominant in the Essay on Criticism, we must readily agree to place
the author among the first critics, though not, as Dr. Johnson says,
"among the first poets," on this account alone. As a poet he must
rank much higher for his Eloïsa and Rape of the Lock. The Essay,
it is said, was first written in prose, according to the precept of Vida,
and the practice of Racine, who was accustomed to draw out in plain
prose, not only the subject of each of the five acts, but of every
scene, and every speech, that he might see the conduct and coherence
of the whole at one view, and would then say, "My tragedy
is finished."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Most of the observations in this Essay are just, and certainly
evince good sense, an extent of reading, and powers of comparison,
considering the age of the author, extraordinary. Johnson's praise
however is exaggerated.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>"Essay" in Pope's day was used in its now obsolete sense of an
attempt. Stephens in 1648 entitled his translation of the five first
books of the Thebais "an Essay upon Statius:" and Denham's
"Essay on the second book of Virgil's Æneis" is a version and not
a dissertation. "I have undertaken," Dryden wrote to Walsh,
"to translate all Virgil; and as an essay have already paraphrased
the third Georgic as an example." Two quotations in Johnson's
Dictionary,&mdash;one from Dryden, the other from Glanville,&mdash;show that
the word was usually understood to imply diffidence. Dryden, in his
Epistle to Roscommon, says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet modestly he does his work survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calls a finished poem an essay;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and Glanville says, "This treatise prides itself in no higher a title
than that of an essay, or imperfect attempt at a subject." Locke
named his great and elaborate work an "Essay on the Human
Understanding," from the consciousness that it was an "imperfect
attempt," and when hostile critics refused him the benefit of his
modest title, he answered that they did his book an honour "in not
suffering it to be an essay." Pope borrowed both the word, and the
plan of his poem, from some works which enjoyed in his youth a
credit far beyond their worth,&mdash;the Essay on Translated Verse by
the Earl of Roscommon, and the Essay on Satire, and the Essay on
Poetry by the Earl of Mulgrave, afterwards Duke of Buckingham.
These small productions had been suggested in their turn by Horace's
Art of Poetry, and its modern imitations. Roscommon and Mulgrave,
men of common-place minds, were incapable of originality,
and Pope, with the latent genius of a leader, was a follower in early
years.</p>

<p>"The things that I have written fastest," said Pope to Spence,
"have always pleased the most. I wrote the Essay on Criticism
fast; for I had digested all the matter in prose before I began upon
it in verse."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This last circumstance was mentioned by Warton in
his Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope, long before the Anecdotes
of Spence were published, and Johnson commented upon the
statement in his review of Warton's work. "There is nothing," he
said, "improbable in the report, nothing indeed but what is more
likely than the contrary; yet I cannot forbear to hint the danger
and weakness of trusting too readily to information. Nothing but experience
could evince the frequency of false information, or enable any
man to conceive that so many groundless reports should be propagated
as every man of eminence may hear of himself. Some men relate
what they think as what they know; some men of confused memories
and habitual inaccuracy ascribe to one man what belongs to
another; and some talk on without thought or care. A few men are
sufficient to broach falsehoods, which are afterwards innocently diffused
by successive relators."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The caution was not intended to discredit
the evidence of Spence. Warton had suppressed his authority, and
Johnson had a proper mistrust of common hearsay.</p>

<p>On the title-page of the poem in the quarto of 1717, it is said,
that it was "written in the year 1709," to which Richardson has
attached the note, "Mr. Pope told me himself that the Essay on
Criticism was, indeed, written 1707, though said 1709 by mistake."
The poet continued the alleged mistake through all succeeding revisions.
The quarto of 1743 was the last edition he superintended, and 1709
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
appears as usual upon the title-page, but Warburton announced in the
final sentence of the commentary, that the Essay was "the work
of an author who had not attained the twentieth year of his age,"
and as the author was born in May, 1688, he must, according to this
testimony, have completed his task before May, 1708, which confirms
the account of Richardson. Pope had thus assigned one date
to his piece on the first page of the quarto of 1743, and sanctioned
the promulgation of a different date on the concluding page. There
is the same contradiction in his conversations with Spence. "My
Essay on Criticism," he said on one occasion, "was written in 1709,
and published in 1711, which is as little time as ever I let anything
of mine lay by me."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This agrees with the printed title-page.
"I showed Walsh," he said to Spence on another occasion, "my
Essay on Criticism in 1706. He died the year after."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This falls in
with the evidence of Richardson and Warburton; for Walsh died on
March 15, 1708, and 1706 was an error for 1707. The double date
reappears in a note to the Pope Letters of 1735, solely through a
change in the punctuation. "Mr. Walsh," it was said in some copies,
"died at 49 years old, in the year 1708, the year after Mr. Pope
writ the Essay on Criticism." "Mr. Walsh," it was said in other
copies, "died at 49 years old in the year 1708, the year after Mr.
Pope writ the Essay on Criticism." In the first version it is asserted
that the poem was written in 1709, or the year after Mr. Walsh died;
in the second version it is asserted that it was written in 1707, and
that Mr. Walsh died the year after. Such a series of conflicting statements
could not all be accidental. When Pope published the quarto
edition of his Letters in 1737, he again altered the note. "Mr.
Walsh," he then said, "died at 49 years old, in the year 1708, the year
before the Essay on Criticism was printed," which informs us of the
new fact that it was printed a couple of years before it was published,
and since the poet assured Spence that it was written two or three
years before it was printed,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> we have the date of its composition once
more thrown back to 1707. Pope forgot the confession in the
poem, ver. 735-740, that in consequence of having "lost his guide"
by the death of Walsh, he was afraid to attempt ambitious themes,
and selected the Essay on Criticism as a topic suited to "low numbers."
However fictitious may have been the reason he assigned for
the choice of his subject, he there admits that he did not form the
design till after the death of his friend in March 1708. In his later
statements he oscillated between the truth, and the desire to magnify
the precocity of his genius. He was always ambitious of the kind
of praise which Johnson bestows upon the Essay, when he calls it
"the stupendous performance of a youth not yet twenty." But at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
whatever period the poem was first written, it did not appear till May,
1711, and represents the capacity of Pope at twenty-three. He
avowedly kept his pieces long in manuscript for the purpose of maturing
and polishing them, and they were as good as he could make
them at the period when they finally left his hands.</p>

<p>The Essay on Criticism was published anonymously. Warton was
informed by Lewis the bookseller, that "it laid many days in his shop
unnoticed and unread." Pope wrote word to Caryll, July 19, 1711,
that he did not expect it would ever arrive at a second edition.
Piqued, said Lewis, at the neglect, the poet one day directed copies
to several great men, and among others to Lord Lansdowne, and the
Duke of Buckingham. These presents caused the work to be talked
about.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The name of the author, which soon transpired, assisted
the sale, and the paper of Addison in the Spectator on December 20,
1711, brought the Essay under the notice of the entire reading world,
though it was still another twelvemonth before the thousand copies
were exhausted.</p>

<p>The notoriety, if not the sale, of the Essay on Criticism must have
been promoted by the angry pamphlet put forth by Dennis six
months before the laudatory paper of Addison appeared in the
Spectator.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Dennis was the only living writer who was openly
abused in the poem, and there was an asperity in the language which
savoured of personal hostility. He and Pope were slightly acquainted.
"At his first coming to town," says Dennis, "he was very importunate
with the late Mr. Henry Cromwell to introduce him to me.
The recommendation of Mr. Cromwell engaged me to be about thrice in
company with him; after which I went into the country, and neither
saw him, nor thought of him, till I found myself insolently attacked
by him in his very superficial Essay on Criticism."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> A passage
quoted by Bowles from Pope's Prologue to the Satires reveals the
cause of the enmity:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soft were my numbers; who could take offence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While pure description held the place of sense?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like gentle Fanny's was my flow'ry theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A painted mistress, or a purling stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never answered,&mdash;I was not in debt.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we learn that Dennis thought meanly of Pope's Pastorals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
The critic had enough taste for true poetry to despise the conventional
puerilities which, more than "pure description, held the place
of sense" in these juvenile effusions. He frequented the coffee-houses
where authors congregated, he indulged in professional talk,
and his unfavourable judgment was sure to get round to Pope. The
irritation at the time must have been great, since the censure continued
to rankle in the mind of the poet at the distance of five-and-twenty
years. His memory was less faithful when he claimed credit
for not replying. He found it convenient to forget that he had
seized an early opportunity for retaliating in the Essay on Criticism.</p>

<p>Dennis complained that "he was attacked in a clandestine manner
in his person instead of his writings." "How the attack," says
Johnson, "was clandestine is not easily perceived, nor how his person
is depreciated." Evidently Dennis termed the attack clandestine,
because the Essay was anonymous, and his assailant concealed. Pope,
however, had not been studious of secrecy among his acquaintances,
and Dennis showed in his pamphlet that he knew perfectly well with
whom he had to deal. His assertion, denied by Johnson, that he
was attacked "in his person instead of his writings" is clearly correct,
unless, contrary to usage, the word is restricted to what is indelible
in a man's bodily make. To say that he reddened at every word
of objection, and stared tremendous with a threatening eye, like the
fierce tyrants depicted in old tapestry, was to represent his personal
bearing and appearance in an offensive light. Pope himself disclaimed
the personality. "I cannot conceive," he wrote to Caryll,
June 25, 1711, "what ground he has for so excessive a resentment,
nor imagine how those three lines can be called a reflection on his
person which only describe him subject to a little colour and stare on
some occasions, which are revolutions that happen sometimes in the
best and most regular faces in Christendom." The description, in
other words, was not a reflection upon the person of Dennis, because
some persons with handsome faces were liable to the same infirmity,
and no satire was personal which did not declare a man to be radically
ugly. That the resentment might seem the more unreasonable, the
stare tremendous and threatening eye, were softened down to a
"little stare." This was characteristic of Pope. He was not afraid
to strike, but when the blow was resented, he frequently made a
hasty and ignominious retreat. Either he pretended that the satire
was not aimed at the individuals who called him to account, or he
gave a mitigated and erroneous version of his lampoons.</p>

<p>Pope lashed Dennis for an intemperance of manner which could be
controlled at will. Dennis upbraided Pope with a deformity which
he had not caused and could not cure. "If you have a mind," said
the infuriated critic, "to enquire between Sunninghill and Oakingham,
for a young, squab, short gentleman, an eternal writer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
amorous pastoral madrigals, and the very bow of the god of Love,
you will be soon directed to him. And pray, as soon as you have
taken a survey of him, tell me whether he is a proper author to make
personal reflections on others. This little author may extol the ancients
as much, and as long as he pleases, but he has reason to thank the good
gods that he was born a modern, for had he been born of Grecian
parents, and his father by consequence had by law the absolute disposal
of him, his life had been no longer than that of one of his
poems,&mdash;the life of half a day."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> There was a wide difference
between ridiculing the distortions of countenance which grew out of
irascible vanity, and mocking at defects which were a misfortune, and
not a fault. But Pope's lines were insulting, and a man of the
world would have foreseen that Dennis would repel insult by scurrility.
The poet was as yet a novice in the coarse personalities of that
abusive age, and he had not anticipated such brutal raillery. "The
latter part of Mr. Dennis's book," he wrote to Caryll, "is no way to
be properly answered, but by a wooden weapon, and I should perhaps
have sent him a present from Windsor Forest of one of the best
and toughest oaken plants between Sunninghill and Oakingham if he
had not informed me in his preface that he is at this time persecuted
by fortune. This, I protest, I knew not the least of before; if I had,
his name had been spared in the Essay for that only reason."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Pope
could no more compete with Dennis in personal prowess, than Dennis
could compete in satire with Pope. His assigned reason for not
executing his empty vaunt was equally hollow. He was not wont to
spare his enemies out of consideration for their necessities, but
taunted them with their forlorn condition, and, true to his custom,
the persecution of fortune, which he said would have induced him to
suppress his satire upon Dennis, was made the ingredient of a fresh
satire at a future day:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never answered; I was not in debt.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The insinuation was unjust. Violent, and often wrong-headed,
Dennis spoke his genuine sentiments, and was not more a hireling
than Pope, or any other author who earns money by his pen. The
poor debtor could not have bartered his honour for a sorrier bribe.
The pamphlet on the Essay on Criticism consisted of thirty-two
octavo pages of small print, with a preface of five pages, and he
received for it 2<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Dennis urged as an aggravation of the "falsehood and calumny"
in the Essay, that they proceeded from a "little affected hypocrite, who
had nothing in his mouth at the same time but truth, candour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
friendship, goodnature, humanity, and magnanimity." These are the
qualities enforced in the poem, and whether the description of Dennis,
under the name of Appius, was a faithful likeness or a caricature, the
attack was at variance with the precepts which accompanied it.
Pope insisted that the specification of faults, to be useful, must be
delicate and courteous. He laid down the proposition at ver. 573, that
"blunt truths do more mischief than nice falsehoods," and at ver. 576,
that "without good breeding truth is disapproved." At the interval
of six lines he exemplified the urbanity he enjoined by a derisive
sketch which could only be intended to injure and exasperate. The
inconsistency did not stop here. He prefaced the obnoxious passage
by the maxim, "those best can bear reproof who merit praise," and
the sketch of Dennis is an illustration of the opposite character.
Was Pope a man who bore reproof with the fortitude which entitled
him to scoff at others for their irritability? He certainly sometimes
drew a flattering picture of his own equanimity and forbearance. He
assures us at ver. 741, that he was "careless of censure." He told
Spence, that "he never much minded what his angry critics published
against him,&mdash;only one or two things at first." "When,"
he added, "I heard for the first time that Dennis had written against
me, it gave me some pain; but it was quite over as soon as I came
to look into his book, and found he was in such a passion."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In the
Prologue to the Satires, he represents himself to have been a perfect
model of candour and amiability, and says of the objections of his
correctors,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If wrong I smiled; if right I kissed the rod.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But he could seldom keep long to one version of any subject, and the
truth comes out in his first Imitation of Horace:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace is my dear delight,&mdash;not Fleury's more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But touch me, and no minister so sore.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>His works bear overwhelming testimony to the fact. His mind was
like inflamed flesh; the touch which a healthy constitution would
have disregarded, tortured and enraged him; his smile was a vindictive
jeer; and he used with acrimony the rod he professed to kiss.
His soreness at censure was the very cause of his charging the weakness
upon Dennis. He was angry at the disparagement of his
Pastorals, and because he himself was testy, he ridiculed the testiness
of his critic. The accusation, according to Dennis, was a
malicious invention. "If a man," he said, "is remarkable for
the extraordinary deference which he pays to the opinions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
remonstrances of his friends, him he libels for his impatience
under reproof."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Though docility was not the virtue of Dennis,
his failing was probably overcharged in the Essay on Criticism,
for unmeasured exaggeration was a usual fault in the satire of Pope.</p>

<p>In retaining a grudge against those who wounded his self-esteem,
Pope did not disdain to profit by their spiteful censorship. "I will
make my enemy," he said to Caryll, "do me a kindness where he
meant an injury, and so serve instead of a friend," and he requested
Trumbull to tell him "where Dennis had hit any blots."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He
cared too much for his works to be influenced by the stubborn pride
which cannot stoop to confess an error. Where the criticism has not
been inspired by malice, authors in general have not been intolerant
of their critics. Coleridge relates that his thankfulness to the reviewers
of his juvenile poems was sincere, when they concurred in
condemning his obscurity, turgid language, and profusion of double
epithets. Of the obscurity he was unconscious, "and my mind," he
says, "was not then sufficiently disciplined to receive the authority
of others as a substitute for my own conviction." "The glitter
both of thought and diction" he pruned with an unsparing hand,
"though, in truth," he adds, "these parasite plants of youthful
poetry had insinuated themselves into my longer poems with such
intricacy of union that I was often obliged to omit disentangling the
weed from the fear of snapping the flower."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The candour and
manliness are charming, but it must not be overlooked that the
magnanimity diminishes as the mental capacity increases. Wakefield
well remarks that one reason why those who merit praise
can best bear reproof is, that the reproof is either counterbalanced by
praise, or by the inward consciousness that the merit is great and will
prevail.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Inferior writers have not the same consolation. The chief
advantage after all which authors derive from the enumeration of
their defects is, that it teaches them modesty, and the true limits of
their powers. They are seldom able to mend. The qualities they
lack are not within their reach; for the mind cannot rise above
itself, and has little pliancy when once it has taken its bent.</p>

<p>The notice in the Spectator must have been doubly welcome to
Pope after the invective and cavils of Dennis. "In our own country,"
says Addison, "a man seldom sets up for a poet without attacking
the reputation of all his brothers in the art. The ignorance of the
moderns, the scribblers of the age, the decay of poetry, are the topics
of detraction with which he makes his entrance into the world. I
am sorry to find that an author, who is very justly esteemed among

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the best judges, has admitted some strokes of this nature into a very
fine poem,&mdash;I mean the Art of Criticism, which was published some
months since, and is a master-piece of its kind. The observations
follow one another like those in Horace's Art of Poetry, without that
methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose author.
They are some of them uncommon, but such as the reader must
assent to, when he sees them explained with that elegance and perspicuity
in which they are delivered. As for those which are the
most known, and the most received, they are placed in so beautiful
a light, and illustrated with such apt allusions, that they have in
them all the graces of novelty, and make the reader, who was before
acquainted with them, still more convinced of their truth and solidity.
And here give me leave to mention what Monsieur Boileau has so
very well enlarged upon in the preface to his works, that wit and
fine writing do not consist so much in advancing things that are
new, as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn. It is
impossible for us, who live in the later ages of the world, to make
observations in criticism, morality, or in any art or science, which
have not been touched upon by others. We have little else left us
but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong,
more beautiful, or more uncommon lights. If a reader examines
Horace's Art of Poetry, he will find but very few precepts in it
which he may not meet with in Aristotle, and which were not commonly
known by all the poets of the Augustan age. His way of
expressing and applying them, not his invention of them, is what we
chiefly admire."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Pope was delighted. "Moderate praise," he said
to Steele, whom he erroneously supposed to have held the pen,
"encourages a young writer, but a great deal may injure him;
and you have been so lavish in this point that I almost hope,&mdash;not
to call in question your judgment in the piece&mdash;that it was some
particular inclination to the author which carried you so far." He
accepted in good part the admonition for disparaging his "brother
moderns," and expressed his willingness to omit the "strokes" in
another edition.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He detected none of the "ill-nature" which Warton
saw lurking in the phrase "that <i>some</i> of the observations were <i>uncommon</i>."
Addison was familiar with the sources from which the
Essay was compiled, and could hardly have been ignorant that even
the "some" was a generous license. He pleaded more plausibly for
the work when he contended that wit consisted in presenting old
thoughts in a better dress, and that the "known truths" in the poem
were "placed in so beautiful a light, that they had all the graces of
novelty." The charge brought later by Pope against Addison, of

viewing him with jealous eyes, suggested to Warton his strained
imputation, which is not warranted by the expression he quotes, and
is contradicted by the genial tone of the praise. Addison at the time
had no acquaintance with Pope. The eulogy on the Essay was
spontaneous, and an envious rival would never have adopted the
suicidal device of voluntarily publishing a strong panegyric in a periodical
which every one read, and of which the decisions were accepted
for law.</p>

<p>The truth is, that Addison, by his encomiums and authority,
brought into vogue the exaggerated estimate entertained of the
Essay. The authors of the next generation read it in their boyhood,
and were taught that it was a model of its kind. Juvenile impressions
retain their hold, and upon no other supposition could we
understand the preposterous opinion of Johnson, that the work set
Pope "among the first critics and the first poets," and that he "never
afterwards excelled it." Warton disputed the rank assigned to the
poet, and assented to the claim put forth for the critic, which was
equally untenable. He was misled by his relish for platitudes. "I
propose," he said, "to make some observations on such passages and
precepts in this Essay as, on account of their utility, novelty, or
elegance, deserve particular attention," and his opening specimen of
these merits is the line,</p>

<span class="i0">In poets as true genius is but rare.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He selected for distinction several other remarks which were not
more exquisite in their form, or recondite in their substance.
Hazlitt took up the strain of Johnson and Warton. "The Rape of
the Lock," he says, "is a double-refined essence of wit and fancy, as
the Essay on Criticism is of wit and sense. The quantity of thought
and observation in this work, for so young a man as Pope was when
he wrote it, is wonderful; unless we adopt the supposition that most
men of genius spend the rest of their lives in teaching others what
they themselves have learned under twenty. The conciseness and
felicity of the expression are equally remarkable. Thus, in reasoning
on the variety of men's opinions, he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis with our judgments, as our watches; none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go just alike, yet each believes his own.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nothing can be more original and happy than the general remarks
and illustrations in the Essay: the critical rules laid down are too
much those of a school, and of a confined one."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> De Quincey, a
subtler and sounder critic than Hazlitt, boldly challenged decisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which had passed, but little questioned, from mouth to mouth.
"The Essay on Criticism," he says, "is the feeblest and least interesting
of Pope's writings, being substantially a mere versification,
like a metrical multiplication table, of common-places the most
mouldy with which criticism has baited its rat-traps. The maxims
have no natural order or logical dependency, are generally so vague as
to mean nothing, and what is remarkable, many of the rules are
violated by no man as often as by Pope, and by Pope nowhere so
often as in this very poem."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The matter of the Essay is not rated,
in this passage, below its value.</p>

<p>"I admired," said Lady Mary W. Montagu, "Mr. Pope's Essay
on Criticism at first very much, because I had not then read any of
the ancient critics, and did not know that it was all stolen."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Pope
had found the bulk of his materials nearer home. He told Spence
that in his youth "he went through all the best critics," and specified
Quintilian, Rapin, and Bossu.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He states in his Essay, ver. 712,
that "critic-learning," in modern times, "flourished most in France,"
and in fact the Rapins and Bossus were his principal masters. They
had been brought into credit with our countrymen by Dryden.
"Impartially speaking," he said, in his Dedication to the Æneis,
"the French are as much better critics than the English as they are
worse poets." He had a wonderful faith in the virtue of their precepts.
"Spenser," he said, "wanted only to have read the rules of
Bossu; for no man was ever born with a greater genius, or had
more knowledge to support it." He compared the French critics to
generals, and our celebrated poets to common soldiers; the poet
executed what the commanding mind of the critic planned.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
treatises which would have perfected the genius of Spenser were
shallow drowsy productions, compounded of truisms, pedantic fallacies,
and doctrines borrowed from antiquity. Pope culled most of
his maxims from these, and other modern works. Many of his
remarks were the common property of the civilised world. A slight
acquaintance with books and men is sufficient to teach us that people
are partial to their own judgment, that some authors are not qualified
to be poets, wits, or critics, and that critics should not launch beyond
their depth. Such profound reflections, kept up throughout the
Essay, owed their credit to the disguising properties of verse. Along
with the singular nicety of distinction, and knowledge of mankind,
Johnson detected a no less surprising range of ancient and modern
learning. Pope mentions Homer, Virgil, and half a dozen Greek and
Latin critics. He has characterised some of these critics in a manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
which betrays that he had never looked into their works, and what
he says of the rest only required that he should know their writings
by repute. All, and more than all, the classical information embodied
in the Essay, might have been picked up from his French manuals
in a single morning.</p>

<p>A didactic poet who draws his precepts from the truisms and current
publications of his day, could not at twenty-three deserve credit
for precocity of learning or thought. He might still manifest an
early maturity of judgment in sifting the insignificant from the important,
the true from the false. Pope did not avoid the trite, but he
is said to have evinced a rare capacity for discriminating the true.
Bowles agrees with Johnson and Warton that "the good sense in the
Essay is extraordinary considering the age of the author," and it is
pronounced "an uncommon effort of critical good sense" by Hallam,
conspicuous himself for sense and sobriety.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Whoever looks through
the speciousness of rhyme, and views the ideas in their naked meaning,
will be much more struck by the want of good sense in the principal
critical canons. They are not even "extraordinary for the age of the
author;" versed as he was in English literature they are below his
years. They are the narrow, erroneous dogmas of a youth fresh from
school-boy studies, who imagined that the Greeks and Romans had
ransacked the illimitable realms of genius and taste, and swept off
the whole of the spoils. He broadly asserted this doctrine in the
poetical creed which he prefixed to his works.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He was at least old
enough then to know better, from whence it is clear that the common
statements respecting him are the opposite of the truth. He did not
display the ripe judgment of manhood in his juvenile criticism; he
remained a boy in criticism when he was a man.</p>

<p>Follow nature, said Pope, in his Essay, but beware of taking nature
at first hand. Homer and nature are the same, and to copy nature
is to copy the rules deduced from his works. The ancients sometimes
deviated into excellence by throwing off their self-imposed shackles.
The moderns must not presume to be irregularly great. They must
keep to the precepts, and if they ever break a rule they must at least
be able to quote a case precisely parallel from a classical author.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The English had not submitted to the wholesome restraint. They
had been "fierce for the liberties of wit," and Pope avows his conviction
that the entire race of English writers were therefore "uncivilised,"
with the exception of a few who had "restored among us
wit's fundamental laws." He names the most illustrious of these
reformers. They were three in number,&mdash;the Duke of Buckingham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Lord Roscommon, and Walsh.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The absurdity could not be exceeded.
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton were "uncivilised"
writers; they not only fell into minor errors, but set at
nought the "<i>fundamental</i> laws" of poetry, while the persons who
taught how English poetry was to be raised from its rude condition
were a trio of prosy mediocrities, whose works might have been annihilated
without leaving the smallest vacuum in literature. "The
Duke of Buckingham," said Pope later, "was superficial in everything;
even in poetry, which was his forte."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Pope seems to have been unconscious of the vast metamorphose
which the world had undergone since the close of the Greek and
Roman eras. Religion, institutions, usages, opinions, all had changed.
Society was in a ferment with new ideas; nations had been
gathered out of new elements; characters were moulded under new
influences, and the play of passions, interests, convictions, and policy
had assumed new forms. This altered order of things was reflected
in our poetry. The mighty men of genius who led the way could
not have put aside their genuine thoughts to mimic works which,
noble in themselves, were musty and obsolete in modern imitations.
The vigorous races which had sprung up drew living pictures from
their own minds; they were inspired by national and present sentiments;
they stamped upon their verse the feelings, humours, and
beliefs of their age. They borrowed from the classics, and sometimes
with bad taste; but the extrinsic details they appropriated
were not permitted to cramp the masculine elasticity of their native
fancy and experience. The materials of the edifice, in the main,
were no longer the same, and neither was the shape they assumed.
The difference was as great as between a Grecian temple and a Gothic
cathedral. The principles which governed the ancients in their compositions
were confined, and did not give verge enough for that variety
and picturesqueness among ourselves which demanded to be embodied
in written words. The originality, which was our glory, appeared a
vice to Pope. The adaptation of the structure to its complex purposes
he believed to be a declension towards barbarism. He would
have preferred that our magnificent English literature, instinct with
the freshness of nature, and gathering into its huge circumference
the growth of centuries, should have been reduced to a stale and
meagre counterfeit. The ancients had the prerogative to make and
break critical laws; the moderns must not dare to think for themselves.
Genius had been free in Greece, and was to be altogether a
slave in England. It cannot be urged in excuse for this protest
against the independence of our literature that Pope had imbibed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
prejudices of his generation. His doctrine was hacknied, but not
allowed. He admits that it had few disciples,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and one of the three
adherents he claimed did not belong to him. "Not only all present
poets," wrote Dryden to Walsh, in 1693, "but all who are to come
in England will thank you for freeing them from the too servile imitation
of the ancients."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The rules of Pope could never have prevailed,
for they were intrinsically false, and would have emasculated
every national literature. The thoughts, words, and deeds of the
actual world would not have been impressed upon its books; a gulf
would have separated the sympathies of the reader from the feeble,
monotonous unrealities of the author, and both author and reader would
soon have grown sick of this unnatural effort to be artificial and dull.</p>

<p>An exclusive partisan of classical poetry, Pope did not the less
denounce sectarians in wit, the contracted spirits "who the ancients
only or the moderns prize," and he exhorted critics "to regard not
if wit be old or new."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The contradiction in his principles was not
accompanied by a corresponding contradiction in his practice, for in
no part of his Essay did he rectify his injustice towards his countrymen.
He had not one word of commendation for any great English
poet, with the exception of Dryden, and him he chiefly extolled, in
company with Denham and Waller, for his metrical euphony. Nay,
Pope limited the fame of our most illustrious writers to barely threescore
years, on the pretence that their language became partially
obsolete, which would yet leave them an enormous advantage over
dead tongues. Because "length of fame (our second life) is lost,"
he exhorted the public in common fairness to recognise merit betimes.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
There was not a semblance of truth in his premise, nor was the plea
which he grounded upon it admissible in his mouth. "How vain,"
he exclaimed, "that second life in other's breath,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and if posthumous
fame was worthless there was no claim for compensation.
In reality the value is not in the posthumous fame, but in the anticipation
which converts it into an immediate possession, the mind
feasting in imagination upon plaudits to come. The successful author
adds them to the chorus of present praise, and the unsuccessful
creates for himself the fame he lacks. The parental partiality which
appeals from contemporaries to posterity may deceive, but it soothes
and sustains. "A reputation after death," said Jortin, "is like a
favourable wind after a shipwreck."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Rather the faith in a future
reputation is the preservative against shipwreck, unless when men are
indifferent to literary immortality.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancients, according to Pope, had a moral as well as an intellectual
superiority. Of old the poets "who but endeavoured well,"
were praised by their brethren. Now those who reached the heights
of Parnassus "employed their pains in spurning down others." Of
old again the professional critic was "generous and fanned the poet's
fire." Now critics hated the poet, and all the more that they had
learned from him the art of criticism.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A freedom from jealousy, a
liberality of eulogy were universal with pagans; malice and envy
reigned supreme in Christendom. Upon this false pretext Pope had
the luxury of indulging in the vice he reprobated. He preached up
"good-nature," he would suffer no leaven of "spleen and sour disdain,"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
and his Essay throughout is a diatribe against English critics.
The entire crew were spiteful blockheads without sense or principle.
The excessive rancour points to some personal offence, and it is probable
that his estimate of critics was regulated by their low opinion
of his Pastorals, which was the chief work he had hitherto published.
When he speaks of poets he keeps no better to the leniency he advocates.
He would "sometimes have censure restrained, and would
charitably let the dull be vain," upon the uncharitable allegation that
the more they were corrected the worse they grew. He engrafts upon
his recommendation of a "charitable silence," an invective against
the inferior versifiers who, in their old age, have not discovered that
they are superannuated. For this inability to detect the decay of
their faculties he calls them "shameless bards, impenitently bold."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
No error of judgment had a stronger claim to be treated with tenderness,
and the bitterness of the passage was the less excusable that it
was certainly directed against his former friend Wycherley.</p>

<p>There are other contradictions in the Essay, and several of the
minor positions are glaringly erroneous. Dennis was within the truth
when he said of the whole that it was "very superficial." There
remains the question whether the poem is remarkable for the beauty
of expression signalised by Addison and Hazlitt. Pope intended his
work to be a combination of highly wrought passages, and of that
more easy style described by Dryden, when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this unpolished, rugged verse I chose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fittest for discourse, and nearest prose.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The parts of the Essay which are pitched in the highest key, are
far the best, and where Pope borrowed the imagery, as in the simile
of the traveller ascending the Alps, the lines owe their splendour to
his improvements. The similes designed to be witty are less happy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
One or two only are good; the rest have little point or appropriateness.
Anxious to string together as many smart comparisons as possible,
Pope was careless of consistency. Speaking of the futility of
abusing paltry versifiers, he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lashed so long, like tops, are lashed asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False steps but help them to renew the race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, after stumbling, jades will mend their pace.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The meaning of the first couplet seems to be that bad poets
become callous by castigation, and indifferent to censure; the meaning
of the second that failure stimulated them to improvement. In
the first couplet they proceed from drowsiness to slumber; in the
second their false steps stir them up to mend their pace. They are
first represented as proceeding from bad to worse, and then from bad
to better.
The attempt in the Essay to turn common prose into rhyme is only
partially successful. Dryden and Byron, the greatest masters in
different ways of the familiar style, pour out words in their natural
order with a marvellous vigour and facility. The merit is in this
unforced idiomatic flow of the language, unimpeded by the shackles
of rhymes. Almost anybody may convert ordinary prose into defective
verse, and much of the verse in the Essay on Criticism is of a
low order. The phraseology is frequently mean and slovenly, the
construction inverted and ungrammatical, the ellipses harsh, the expletives
feeble, the metre inharmonious, the rhymes imperfect. Striving
to be poetical, Pope fell below bald and slip-shod prose. Examples
lie thick, and a couple of specimens will be enough:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But when t'examine ev'ry part he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The transposition of the verb for the sake of the rhyme was the
rule with Pope. He habitually succumbed to the difficulty of preserving
the legitimate arrangement of words; yet it is an anomaly in
literature that with his powers and patient industry he could tolerate
such despicable examples of the licence, and this in enunciating
hacknied precepts, only to be raised above insipidity by the perfection
with which they were moulded into verse. Where the plain
portions of the poem are not positively bad, they are seldom of
any peculiar excellence. Mediocrity, relieved by occasional well-wrought
passages, forms the staple of the work, and Hazlitt must
surely have given loose to one of his wilful paradoxes when he contended
that the general characteristics of the Essay were originality,
thought, strength, terseness, wit, felicitous expression, and brilliant
illustration.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>In its metrical qualities the Essay on Criticism is the worst of
Pope's poems. One blemish is a want of variety in his final words.
"There are," says Hazlitt, "no less than half a score couplets
rhyming to <i>sense</i>. This appears almost incredible without giving the
instances, and no less so when they are given."</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The corresponding word which forms the rhyme is not always
varied. "Offence" is used three times, and "defence" and "pretence"
are each employed twice.</p>

<p>Hazlitt might have remarked, that <i>wit</i> was even more favoured than
<i>sense</i>, and was used with greater laxity. A wit, in the reign of
Queen Anne was not only a jester, but any author of distinction;
and wit, besides its special signification, was still sometimes employed
as synonymous with mind. The ordinary generic and specific meanings,
already confusing and fruitful in ambiguities, were not sufficient
for Pope. A wit with him was now a jester, now an author, now a
poet, and now, again, was contradistinguished from poets. Wit was
the intellect, the judgment, the antithesis to judgment, a joke, and
poetry. The word does duty, with a perplexing want of precision,
throughout the essay, and furnishes a dozen rhymes alone:</p>

<p>In these twelve instances "wit" rhymes five times to "fit,"
and three times to "writ." The monotony extends much farther.

<p>are not much better. Many of the verses, and this last is a specimen,
offend the ear by the succession of "low" and "creeping words."
Pope belonged to the class of kings he mentions in his poem, who
freely dispensed with the laws they had made.</p>

<p>Johnson, commenting on Pope's attempt to adapt the sound to the
sense, thinks it a contradiction, that he employed an Alexandrine to
describe the swiftness of Camilla, and thirty years afterwards used
the same measure to denote "the march of slow-paced majesty."
There was no need to look for an instance at the interval of thirty
years. It would have been found at an interval of half thirty lines
in the Essay on Criticism, where an Alexandrine is introduced to
portray the dragging progress of the wounded snake. The juxtaposition
was doubtless deliberate for the purpose of illustrating the
opposite movements of sluggishness and celerity. Johnson misunderstood
the theory. The Alexandrine was not supposed to represent
speed, but space. Thus when Pope describes the wound of Menelaus,
in his translation of the Iliad, he says in a note, "Homer is very
particular here in giving the picture of the blood running in a long
trace, lower and lower. The author's design being only to image the
streaming of the blood, it seemed equivalent to make it trickle through
the length of an Alexandrine line."</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As down thy snowy thigh distilled the streaming flood.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A long line being presumed to suggest the motion of a long distance,
the retarded or accelerated motion was intended to be expressed
by the slow or rapid syllables of which the line was composed.
The end was not answered, because, as Johnson remarks, the break
in the middle of the Alexandrine is antagonistic to haste, and he has
equally shown that Pope was not happy in the application of his
mistaken rule. The slow march outstrips the swift Camilla, who is
even left behind by the wounded snake in the first half of the line.
Had the examples been a complete illustration of the theory, the gain
would have been nothing. Representative metre, in the strict sense
of the term, though sanctioned by eminent names, would degrade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
poetry. There cannot be a paltrier poetic effect than to mimic the
roll of stones, the trickling of blood, and the dragging motion of
wounded snakes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walsh used to tell me," says Pope, "that there was one
way left of excelling; for though we had several great poets, we
never had any one great poet that was correct, and he desired me to
make that my study and aim."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Warton calls this "very important
advice,"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and both he and Pope seem to assume that it had
been effectual. The notion has been generally accepted. "To distinguish
this triumvirate from each other," says Young, "Swift is a
singular wit, Pope a correct poet, Addison a great author."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> "He
is the most perfect of our poets," said Byron; "the only poet
whose faultlessness has been made his reproach."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Hazlitt took the
opposite side. "Those critics who are bigoted idolisers of our
author, chiefly on the score of his correctness, seem to be of opinion
that there is but one perfect writer, even Pope. This is, however, a
mistake; his excellence is by no means faultlessness. If he had no
great faults, he is full of little errors. His grammatical construction
is often lame and imperfect. His rhymes are constantly defective,
being rhymes to the eye instead of the ear; and this to a greater
degree, not only than in later, but than in preceding, writers. The
praise of his versification must be confined to its uniform smoothness
and harmony. In the translation of the Iliad, which has been considered
as his masterpiece in style and execution, he continually
changes the tenses in the same sentence for the purposes of the
rhyme, which shows either a want of technical resources, or great
inattention to punctilious exactness."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> De Quincey confirms Hazlitt;
but, with his profounder knowledge of the characteristics of Pope's
poetry, he saw that the incorrectness was spread wider, and went
deeper. "Let us ask," he says, "what is meant by correctness?
Correctness in developing the thought? In connecting it, or effecting
the transitions? In the use of words? In the grammar? In the
metre?" In all these points he maintains that Pope, "by comparison
with other great poets, was conspicuously deficient."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> For
an example of incorrectness in developing the thought De Quincey
refers to the character of Addison:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who would not laugh, if such a man there be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who but must weep if Atticus were he?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Why must we laugh? Because we find a grotesque assembly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
noble and ignoble qualities. Very well; but why, then, must we
weep? Because this assemblage is found actually existing in an
eminent man of genius. Well, that is a good reason for weeping;
we weep for the degradation of human nature. But then revolves
the question, Why must we laugh? Because, if the belonging to a
man of genius were a sufficient reason for weeping, so much we know
from the very first. The very first line says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace to all such: but were there one whose fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>True genius kindles</i>, and fair fame aspires.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus falls to the ground the whole antithesis of this famous character.
We are to change our mood from laughter to tears upon a
sudden discovery that the character belonged to a man of genius;
and this we had already known from the beginning. Match us this
prodigious oversight in
Shakspeare."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Pope was still more deficient
in logical correctness, in the power of preserving consistency, and
coherency between congregated ideas. "Of all poets," says De
Quincey, "that have practised reasoning in verse he is the one
most inconsequential in the deduction of his thoughts, and the most
severely distressed in any effort to effect or to explain the dependency
of their parts. There are not ten consecutive lines in Pope
unaffected by this infirmity. All his thinking proceeded by insulated
and discontinuous jets, and the only resource for him, or chance of
even seeming correctness, lay in the liberty of stringing his aphoristic
thoughts, like pearls, having no relation to each other but that of
contiguity."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Many of his arguments are capable of a double construction;
absolute contradictions are not uncommon; and when we
try to get a connected view of his principles we are irritated by their
discordance, indefiniteness, and obscurity. As little will his grammar
bear the test of correctness. "His syntax," says De Quincey, "is
so bad as to darken his meaning at times, and at other times to
defeat it. Preterites and participles he constantly confounds, and
registers this class of blunders for ever by the cast-iron index of
rhymes that never <i>can</i> mend." Another defect of language was, in
De Quincey's opinion, "almost peculiar to Pope." "The language
does not realise the idea: it simply suggests or hints it. Thus, to
give a single illustration:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Know God and Nature only are the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In man the judgment shoots at flying game.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The first line one would naturally construe into this: that God and
Nature were in harmony, whilst all other objects were scattered into
incoherency by difference and disunion. Not at all; it means nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the kind; but that God and Nature only are exempted from the
infirmities of change. This <i>might</i> mislead many readers; but the
second line <i>must</i> do so: for who would not understand the syntax to
be, that the judgment, as it exists in man, shoots at flying game?
But, in fact, the meaning is, that the judgment in aiming its calculations
at man, aims at an object that is still on the wing, and never
for a moment stationary."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This, De Quincey contends, is the worst
of all possible faults in diction, since perspicuity, ungrammatical and
inelegant, is preferable to conundrums of which the solution is difficult,
and often doubtful. He says that there are endless varieties of
the vice in Pope, and that "he sought relief for himself from half an
hour's labour at the price of utter darkness to his reader." De
Quincey was in error when he imputed the imperfections to indolence.
There never was a more painstaking poet than Pope. His
works were slowly elaborated, and diligently revised. "I corrected,"
he says, "because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write,"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and his manuscripts attest his untiring efforts to mend his composition.
Language and not industry failed him. Happy in a multitude
of phrases, lines, couplets, and passages, his vocabulary and
turns of expression were often unequal to the exactions of verse.
Not even rhymes, dearly purchased by violations of grammar and a
false order of words, nor the imperfection of the rhymes themselves,
could always enable him to satisfy the double requirement of metre
and clearness. Most of his usual deviations from correctness are
especially prominent in the Essay on Criticism, and any one who
reads it with common attention might be tempted to think that the
claim which Warton and others set up for Pope, was an insidious
device to injure his reputation by diverting attention from his merits,
and basing his fame upon a foundation too unstable to support it.
The advice of Walsh was foolish. A poet who believed originality to
be exhausted, and who merely aspired to echo his predecessors, with
no distinguishing quality of his own beyond some additional correctness,
might have spared his pains. The correct imitator would be
intolerable by the side of the fresh and vigorous genius he copied.
The assumption that the domain of poetic thought had been traversed
in every direction, and that no untrodden paths were left for future
explorers, was itself a delusion, soon to be refuted by Pope's own
Rape of the Lock. Many immortal works have since belied the
shallow doctrine of Walsh, who made his dim perceptions the measure
of intellectual possibilities. The aspects under which the world,
animate and inanimate, may be regarded by the poet are practically
endless. The latent truths of science do not offer to the philosopher
a more unbounded field of novelty.</p>

APPENDIX.

<p>Dr. Warburton, endeavouring to demonstrate, what Addison could
not discover, nor what Pope himself, according to the testimony of
his intimate friend, Richardson, ever thought of or intended, that this
Essay was written with a methodical and systematical regularity, has
accompanied the whole with a long and laboured commentary, in
which he has tortured many passages to support this groundless
opinion. Warburton had certainly wit, genius, and much miscellaneous
learning; but was perpetually dazzled and misled, by the
eager desire of seeing everything in a new light unobserved before,
into perverse interpretations and forced comments. It is painful to
see such abilities wasted on such unsubstantial objects. Accordingly
his notes on Shakspeare have been totally demolished by Edwards
and Malone; and Gibbon has torn up by the roots his fanciful and
visionary interpretation of the sixth book of Virgil. And but few
readers, I believe, will be found that will cordially subscribe to an
opinion lately delivered,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> that his notes on Pope's Works are the very
best ever given on any classic whatever. For, to instance no other,
surely the attempt to reconcile the doctrines of the Essay on Man to
the doctrines of revelation, is the rashest adventure in which ever
critic yet engaged. This is, in truth, to divine, rather than to explain
an author's meaning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>If this Commentary were only a perverse and forced interpretation,
as Warton insinuates, it is scarcely likely that Pope would have
approved of it so highly, as not only to speak of it in the warmest
terms of admiration, but to allow it to accompany his own edition of
the poem. To assert that Pope was not the best judge of his own
meaning, is an insult not only to his understanding, but to common
sense; and to discard the commentary of Warburton, as Warton has
done in his edition, in order to replace it by a series of notes, intended
to impress the reader with his own opinions, is a kind of infringement
on those rights, which had already been decided on by the only person
who was entitled to judge on the subject. For these reasons I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
thought it advisable, in this edition, to restore the commentary of
Warburton entire, which has only been partially done by Mr. Bowles;
conceiving that it is as injurious, if not more so, to the commentator,
whose object it is to demonstrate the order and consistency of the
poem, to deprive him of a portion of his remarks, as it is to deprive
him of them altogether.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span></p>

<p>Warburton's commentary proceeded upon two assumptions, which
are not complimentary to Pope. The first was that a poem which
had contracted no obscurity from age, and which consisted of a series
of simple precepts, was written in a manner so confused that it would
not be intelligible to ordinary readers, unless the whole was retold in
cumbrous prose. The second assumption was that Pope was so
deficient in power of expression that his ideas were constantly at
variance with his words. One of the sarcastic canons of criticism
which Edwards deduced from Warburton's Shakspeare was that an
editor "may interpret his author so as to make him mean directly
contrary to what he says," and certain it is that if Warburton's
explanations are correct, Pope's language was often sadly inaccurate.
Roscoe, in effect, adopts the last solution, for he urges that Pope,
who was the best judge of his own meaning, acknowledged his meaning
to be that which Warburton ascribed to him. There is another, and
more probable alternative. Though Pope undeniably knew his own
meaning best, his vanity may have been gratified by the subtle views
which were imputed to him, and he may have had the weakness, in
consequence, to adopt interpretations which never crossed his mind
when he composed his poem. Since, however, he desired that his
works should be read by the light of Warburton's paraphrase, an
editor is not warranted in overruling the decision of the author, and
on this account the commentary and notes of Warburton are printed
in their integrity, though in themselves they are tedious, verbose,
and barren.</p>

<span class="em1point76">ESSAY ON CRITICISM.</span></h2>


<h3>COMMENTARY.</h3>

<p><i>An Essay.</i>] The poem is in one book, but divided into three principal parts
or members. The first, to ver. 201, gives rules for the study of the art of
criticism: the second, from thence to ver. 560, exposes the causes of wrong
judgment: and the third, from thence to the end, marks out the morals of the
critic.</p>

<p>In order to a right conception of this poem, it will be necessary to observe,
that though it be entitled simply An Essay on Criticism, yet several of the
precepts relate equally to the good writing as well as to the true judging of a
poem. This is so far from violating the unity of the subject, that it preserves
and completes it: or from disordering the regularity of the form, that it adds
beauty to it, as will appear by the following considerations: 1. It was impossible
to give a full and exact idea of the art of poetical criticism, without considering
at the same time the art of poetry; so far as poetry is an art. These
therefore being closely connected in nature, the author has, with much judgment,
interwoven the precepts of each reciprocally through his whole poem. 2.
As the rules of the ancient critics were taken from poets who copied nature,
this is another reason why every poet should be a critic: therefore as the subject
is poetical criticism, it is frequently addressed to the critical poet. And
3dly, the art of criticism is as properly, and much more usefully exercised in
writing than in judging.</p>

<p>But readers have been misled by the modesty of the title, which only
promises an art of criticism, to expect little, where they will find a great deal,&mdash;a
treatise, and that no incomplete one, of the art both of criticism and
poetry. This, and the not attending to the considerations offered above,
was what, perhaps misled a very candid writer, after having given the
Essay on Criticism all the praises on the side of genius and poetry which
his true taste could not refuse it, to say, that "the observations follow one
another like those in Horace's Art of Poetry, without that methodical regularity
which would have been requisite in a prose writer." Spect. No. 235.
I do not see how method can hurt any one grace of poetry: or what prerogative
there is in verse to dispense with regularity. The remark is false in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
part of it. Mr. Pope's Essay on Criticism, the reader will soon see, is a
regular piece, and a very learned critic has lately shown that Horace had the
same attention to method in his Art of Poetry. See Mr. Hurd's Comment on
the Epistle to the Pisos.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Ver. 1. <i>'Tis hard to say, &amp;c.</i>] The poem opens, from ver. 1 to 9, with
showing the use and seasonableness of the subject. Its use, from the greater
mischief in wrong criticism than in ill poetry&mdash;this only tiring, that misleading
the reader. Its seasonableness, from the growing number of bad critics,
which now vastly exceeds that of bad poets.</p>

<p>Ver. 9. <i>'Tis with our judgments, &amp;c.</i>] The author having shown us the
expediency of his subject, the art of criticism, inquires next, from ver. 8 to
15, into the proper qualities of a true critic, and observes first, that judgment
alone is not sufficient to constitute this character, because judgment, like the
artificial measures of time, goes different, and yet each man relies upon his
own. The reasoning is conclusive, and the similitude extremely just. For
judgment, when it is alone, is generally regulated, or at least much influenced,
by custom, fashion, and habit; and never certain and constant but when
founded upon and accompanied by taste, which is in the critic, what in the poet
we call genius. Both are derived from heaven, and like the sun, the natural
measure of time, always constant and equable.</p>

<p>Judgment alone, it is allowed, will not make a poet; where is the wonder
then, that it will not make a critic in poetry? For on examination we shall
find, that genius and taste are but one and the same faculty, differently exerting
itself under different names, in the two professions of poetry and criticism.
The art of poetry consists in selecting, out of all those images which present
themselves to the fancy, such of them as are truly beautiful; and the art of
criticism in discerning, and fully relishing what it finds so selected. The
main difference is, that in the poet, this faculty is eminently joined to a bright
imagination, and extensive comprehension, which provide stores for the selection,
and can form that selection, by proportioned parts, into a regular whole:
in the critic, it is joined to a solid judgment and accurate discernment, which
can penetrate into the causes of an excellence, and display that excellence in
all its variety of lights. Longinus had taste in an eminent degree; therefore,
this quality, which all true critics have in common, our author makes his distinguishing
character:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless their critic with a poet's fire.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>i. e.</i> with taste, or genius.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></div>
<p>Ver. 15. <i>Let such teach others, &amp;c.</i>] But it is not enough that the critic
hath these natural endowments of judgment and taste, to entitle him to exercise
his art; he should, as our author shows us, from ver. 14 to 19, in order
to give a further test of his qualification, have put them successfully into use.
And this on two accounts: 1. Because the office of a critic is an exercise of
authority. 2. Because he being naturally as partial to his judgment as the
poet is to his wit, his partiality would have nothing to correct it, as that of
the person judged hath by the very terms. Therefore some test is necessary;
and the best and most unexceptionable, is his having written well himself&mdash;an
approved remedy against critical partiality, and the surest means of so
maturing the judgment as to reap with glory what Longinus calls "the last
and most perfect fruits of much study and experience." Η γαρ των
λογων κρισις πολλης εστι πειρας τελευταιον επιγεννημα.</p>

<p>Ver. 19. <i>Yet, if we look, &amp;c.</i>] But the author having been thus free with
the fundamental quality of criticism, judgment, so as to charge it with inconstancy
and partiality, and to be often warped by custom and affection, that he
may not be misunderstood, he next explains, from ver. 18 to 36, the nature of
judgment, and the accidents occasioning those miscarriages before objected to
it. He owns, that the seeds of judgment are indeed sown in the minds of
most men, but by ill culture, as it springs up, it generally runs wild, either
on the one hand, by false learning, which pedants call philology, and by false
reasoning, which philosophers call school-learning, or, on the other, by
false wit, which is not regulated by sense, and by false politeness,
which is solely regulated by the fashion. Both these sorts, who have their
judgment thus doubly depraved, the poet observes, are naturally turned to
censure and abuse, only with this difference, that the learned dunce always
affects to be on the reasoning, and the unlearned fool on the laughing side.
And thus, at the same time, our author proves the truth of his introductory
observation, that the number of bad critics is vastly superior to that of bad
poets.</p>

<p>Ver. 36. <i>Some have at first for wits, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having enumerated, in
this account of the nature of judgment and its various depravations, the
several sorts of bad critics, and ranked them into two general classes, as the
first sort,&mdash;namely, the men spoiled by false learning&mdash;are but few in comparison
of the other, and likewise come less within his main view (which is
poetical criticism) but keep grovelling at the bottom amongst words and
syllables, he thought it enough for his purpose here, just to have mentioned
them, proposing to do them right hereafter. But the men spoiled by false
taste are innumerable, and these are his proper concern. He therefore,
from ver. 35 to 46, subdivides them again into the two classes of the volatile
and heavy. He describes, in few words, the quick progression of the one
through criticism, from false wit to plain folly, where they end; and the fixed
station of the other, between the confines of both; who under the name of
witlings, have neither end nor measure. A kind of half-formed creature from
the equivocal generation of vivacity and dulness, like those on the banks of
Nile, from heat and mud.</p>

<p>Ver. 46. <i>But you who seek, &amp;c.</i>] Our author having thus far, by way of
introduction, explained the nature, use, and abuse of criticism, in a figurative
description of the qualities and characters of critics, proceeds now to
deliver the precepts of the art. The first of which, from ver. 45 to 68, is,
that he who sets up for a critic should previously examine his own strength,
and see how far he is qualified for the exercise of his profession. He puts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
him in a way to make this discovery, in that admirable direction given
ver. 51.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And mark that point where sense and dulness meet. </span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He had shown above, that judgment, without taste or genius, is equally incapable
of making a critic or a poet. In whatsoever subject then the critic's
taste no longer accompanies his judgment, there he may be assured he is going
out of his depth. This our author finely calls,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">that point where sense and dulness meet. </span>
</div></div></div>


<p>and immediately adds the reason of his precept, the author of nature having
so constituted the mental faculties, that one of them can never greatly excel,
but at the expense of another. From this state of co-ordination in the mental
faculties, and the influence and effects they have upon one another, the poet
draws this consequence, that no one genius can excel in more than one art or
science. The consequence shows the necessity of the precept, just as the
premises, from which the consequence is drawn, show the reasonableness
of it.</p>

<p>Ver. 68. <i>First follow nature, &amp;c.</i>] The critic observing the directions
before given, and now finding himself qualified for his office, is shown next
how to exercise it. And as he was to attend to nature for a call, so he is first
and principally to follow nature when called. And here again in this, as in
the foregoing precept, our poet, from ver. 67 to 88, shows both the fitness
and necessity of it. I. Its fitness. 1. Because nature is the source of poetic
art, this art being only a representation of nature, who is its great exemplar
and original. 2. Because nature is the end of art, the design of poetry being
to convey the knowledge of nature in the most agreeable manner. 3. Because
nature is the test of art, as she is unerring, constant, and still the same.
Hence the poet observes, that as nature is the source, she conveys life to art;
as she is the end, she conveys force to it, for the force of any thing arises from
its being directed to its end; and as she is the test, she conveys beauty to it,
for everything acquires beauty by its being reduced to its true standard. Such
is the sense of these two important lines,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life, force, and beauty must to all impart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the source, and end, and test of art.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>II. The necessity of the precept is seen from hence. The two constituent qualities
of a composition, as such, are art and wit; but neither of these attains
perfection, till the first be hid, and the other judiciously restrained. This only
happens when nature is exactly followed; for then art never makes a parade;
nor can wit commit an extravagance. Art, while it adheres to nature, and
has so large a fund in the resources which nature supplies, disposes every
thing with so much ease and simplicity, that we see nothing but those natural
images it works with, while itself stands unobserved behind; but when art
leaves nature, misled either by the bold sallies of fancy, or the quaint oddness
of fashion, she is then obliged at every step to come forward, in a painful or
pompous ostentation, in order to cover, to soften, or to regulate the shocking
disproportion of unnatural images. In the first case, our poet compares art
to the soul within, informing a beauteous body; but in the last, we are bid to
consider it but as a mere outward garb, fitted only to hide the defects of a misshapen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
one. As to wit, it might perhaps be imagined that this needed only
judgment to govern it; but, as he well observes,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">wit and judgment often are at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>They want therefore some friendly mediator; and this mediator is nature:
and in attending to nature, judgment will learn where he should comply
with the charms of wit; and wit how she ought to obey the sage directions
of judgment.</p>

<p>Ver. 88. <i>Those rules of old, &amp;c.</i>] Having thus, in his first precept, to follow
nature, settled criticism on its true foundation; he proceeds to show, what
assistance may be had from art. But lest this should be thought to draw the
critic from the ground where our poet had before fixed him, he previously
observes, from ver. 87 to 92, that these rules of art, which he is now about
to recommend to the critic's observance, were not invented by abstract speculation;
but discovered in the book of nature; and that therefore, though they
may seem to restrain nature by laws, yet as they are laws of her own making,
the critic is still properly in the very liberty of nature. These rules the
ancient critics borrowed from the poets, who received them immediately from
nature.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These drew from them what they derived from heav'n,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>so that both are to be well studied.</p>

<p>Ver. 92. <i>Hear how learn'd Greece, &amp;c.</i>] He speaks of the ancient critics
first, and with great judgment, as the previous knowledge of them is necessary
for reading the poets, with that fruit which the end here proposed requires.
But having, in the foregoing observation, sufficiently explained the nature of
ancient criticism, he enters on the subject treated of from ver. 91 to 118,
with a sublime description of its end; which was to illustrate the beauties of
the best writers, in order to excite others to an emulation of their excellence.
From the raptures which these ideas inspire, the poet is brought back, by the
follies of modern criticism, now before his eyes, to reflect on its base degeneracy.
And as the restoring the art to its original purity and splendour is the
great purpose of this poem, he first takes notice of those, who seem not to
understand that nature is exhaustless; that new models of good writing may
be produced in every age; and consequently, that new rules may be formed
from these models, in the same manner as the old critics formed theirs, which
was, from the writings of the ancient poets: but men wanting art and ability
to form these new rules, were content to receive and file up for use, the old
ones of Aristotle, Quintilian, Longinus, Horace, &amp;c. with the same vanity and
boldness that apothecaries practise, with their doctors' bills: and then rashly
applying them to new originals (cases which they did not hit) it was no more
in their power, than in their inclination, to imitate the candid practice of the
ancients when</p>

<p>For, as ignorance, when joined with humility, produces stupid admiration, on

gives birth to every iniquity of impudent abuse and slander. See an example

an inverted order, himself above, and Sprat, Rollin, Voltaire, and every other

<p>Ver. 118. <i>You then whose judgment, &amp;c.</i>] He comes next to the ancient
poets, the other and more intimate commentators of nature, and shows, from
ver. 117 to 141, that the study of these must indispensably follow that of
the ancient critics, as they furnish us with what the critics, who only give
us general rules, cannot supply, while the study of a great original poet, in</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His fable, subject, scope in ev'ry page:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religion, country, genius of his age;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>will help us to those particular rules which only can conduct us safely through
every considerable work we undertake to examine; and without which, we
may cavil indeed, as the poet truly observes, but can never criticise. We
might as well suppose that Vitruvius's book alone would make a perfect judge
of architecture, without the knowledge of some great master-piece of science,
such as the rotunda at Rome, or the temple of Minerva at Athens, as that
Aristotle's should make a perfect judge of wit, without the study of Homer
and Virgil. These therefore he principally recommends to complete the critic
in his art. But as the latter of these poets has, by superficial judges, been
considered rather as a copier of Homer, than an original from nature, our
author obviates that common error, and shows it to have arisen (as often error
does) from a truth, <i>viz.</i>, that Homer and nature were the same; that the ambitious
young poet, though he scorned to stoop at anything short of nature,
when he came to understand this great truth, had the prudence to contemplate
nature in the place where she was seen to most advantage, collected in
all her charms in the clear mirror of Homer. Hence it would follow, that
though Virgil studied nature, yet the vulgar reader would believe him to be a
copier of Homer; and though he copied Homer, yet the judicious reader would
see him to be an imitator of nature, the finest praise which any one, who came
after Homer, could receive.</p>

<p>Ver. 141. <i>Some beauties yet no precepts can declare, &amp;c.</i>] Our author, in
these two general directions for studying nature and her commentators, having
considered poetry as it is, or may be reduced to rule, lest this should be mistaken
as sufficient to attain perfection either in writing or judging, he proceeds
from ver. 140 to 201, to point up to those sublimer beauties which rules
will never reach, nor enable us either to execute or taste,&mdash;beauties, which rise
so high above all precept as not even to be described by it; but being entirely
the gift of heaven, art and reason have no further share in them than just
to regulate their operations. These sublimities of poetry (like the mysteries
of religion, some of which are above reason, and some contrary to it) may be
divided into two sorts, such as are above rules, and such as are contrary to
them.</p>

<p>Ver. 146. <i>If, where the rules, &amp;c.</i>] The first sort our author describes from
ver. 145 to 152, and shows that where a great beauty is in the poet's view,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
which no stated rules will authorise him how to reach, there, as the purpose of
rules is only to attain an end like this, a lucky licence will supply the place
of them: nor can the critic fairly object, since this licence, for the reason
given above, has the proper force and authority of a rule.</p>

<p>Ver. 152. <i>Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend, &amp;c.</i>] He describes
next the second sort, the beauties against rule. And even here, as he observes,
from ver. 151 to 161, the offence is so glorious, and the fault so sublime, that
the true critic will not dare either to censure or reform them. Yet still the
poet is never to abandon himself to his imagination. The rules laid down for
his conduct in this respect are these: 1. That though he transgress the letter
of some one particular precept, yet that he be still careful to adhere to the
end or spirit of them all, which end is the creation of one uniform perfect
whole. And 2. That he have, in each instance, the authority of the dispensing
power of the ancients to plead for him. These rules observed, this
licence will be seldom used, and only when he is compelled by need, which
will disarm the critic, and screen the offender from his laws.</p>

<p>Ver. 169. <i>I know there are, &amp;c.</i>] But as some modern critics have pretended
to say, that this last reason is only justifying one fault by another, our
author goes on, from ver. 168 to 181, to vindicate the ancients; and to show
that this presumptuous thought, as he calls it, proceeds from mere ignorance,&mdash;as
where their partiality will not let them see that this licence is sometimes
necessary for the symmetry and proportion of a perfect whole, in the light,
and from the point, wherein it must be viewed; or where their haste will not
give them time to observe, that a deviation from rule is for the sake of attaining
some great and admirable purpose. These observations are further useful,
as they tend to give modern critics an humbler opinion of their own abilities,
and a higher of the authors they undertake to criticise. On which account
he concludes with a fine reproof of their use of that common proverb perpetually
in the mouths of the critics, "quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus;"
misunderstanding the sense of Horace, and taking quandoque for aliquando:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 181. <i>Still green with bays, &amp;c.</i>] But now fired with the name of
Homer, and transported with the contemplation of those beauties which a
cold critic can neither see nor conceive, the poet, from ver. 180 to 201, breaks
out into a rapturous salutation of the rare felicity of those few ancients who
have risen superior over time and accidents; and disdaining, as it were, any
longer to reason with his critics, offers this as the surest confutation of their
censures. Then with the humility of a suppliant at the shrine of immortals,
and the sublimity of a poet participating of their fire, he turns again to these
ancient worthies, and apostrophises their Manes:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hail, bards triumphant! &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 200. <i>T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!</i>] This line concludes
the first division of the poem; in which we see the subject of the first
and second part, and likewise the connexion they have with one another. It
serves likewise to introduce the second. The effect of studying the ancients,
as here recommended, would be the admiration of their superior sense, which,
if it will not of itself dispose moderns to a diffidence of their own (one of the
great uses, as well as natural fruits of that study), our author, to help forward
their modesty, in his second part shows them (in a regular deduction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
causes and effects of wrong judgment) their own bright image and amiable
turn of mind.</p>

<p>Ver. 201. <i>Of all the causes, &amp;c.</i>] Having, in the first part, delivered rules
for perfecting the art of criticism, the second is employed in explaining the
impediments to it. The order of the two parts was well adjusted. For the
causes of wrong judgment being pride, superficial learning, a bounded capacity,
and partiality, they to whom this part is principally addressed, would
not readily be brought either to see the malignity of the causes, or to own
themselves concerned in the effects, had not the author previously both enlightened
and convinced them, by the foregoing observations, on the vastness
of art, and narrowness of wit; the extensive study of human nature and
antiquity; and the characters of ancient poetry and criticism; the natural
remedies to the four epidemic disorders he is now endeavouring to redress.</p>

<p>Ver. 201. <i>Of all the causes, &amp;c.</i>] The first cause of wrong judgment is pride.
He judiciously begins with this, from ver. 200 to 215, as on other accounts,
so on this, that it is the very thing which gives modern criticism its character,
whose complexion is abuse and censure. He calls it the vice of fools, by which
term is not meant those to whom nature has given no judgment (for he is here
speaking of what misleads the judgment), but those to whom learning and
study have given more erudition than taste, as appears from the happy similitude
of an ill-nourished body, where the same words which express the cause,
express likewise the nature of pride:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wants in blood and spirits, swelled with wind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is the business of reason, he tells us, to dispel the cloud in which pride
involves the mind: but the mischief is, that the rays of reason, diverted by
self-love, sometime gild this cloud, instead of dispelling it. So that the judgment,
by false lights reflected back upon itself, is still apt to be a little dazzled,
and to mistake its object. He therefore advises to call in still more helps:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Trust not yourself; but your defects to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make use of ev'ry friend and ev'ry foe.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Both the beginning and conclusion of this precept are remarkable. The
question is of the means to subdue pride. He directs the critic to begin with a
distrust of himself; and this is modesty, the first mortification of pride: and
then to seek the assistance of others, and make use even of an enemy; and
this is humility, the last mortification of pride: for when a man can once
bring himself to submit to profit by an enemy, he has either already subdued
his vanity, or is in a fair way of so doing.</p>

<p>Ver. 215. <i>A little learning, &amp;c.</i>] We must here remark the poet's skill in
his disposition of the causes obstructing true judgment. Each general cause
which is laid down first, has its own particular cause in that which follows.
Thus, the second cause of wrong judgment, superficial learning, is what occasions
that critical pride, which he places first.</p>

<p>Ver. 216. <i>Drink deep, &amp;c.</i>] Nature and learning are the pole-stars of all
true criticism: but pride obstructs the view of nature; and a smattering of
letters makes us insensible of our ignorance. To avoid this ridiculous situation,
the poet, from ver. 214 to 233, advises, either to drink deep, or not to
drink at all; for the least sip at this fountain is enough to make a bad critic,
while even a moderate draught can never make a good one. And yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
labours and difficulties of drinking deep are so great, that a young author,
"fired with ideas of fair Italy," and ambitious to snatch a palm from Rome,
here engages in an undertaking like that of Hannibal: finely illustrated by
the similitude of an inexperienced traveller penetrating through the Alps.</p>

<p>Ver. 233. <i>A perfect judge, &amp;c.</i>] The third cause of wrong judgment is a
narrow capacity; the natural cause of the foregoing defect, acquiescence in
superficial learning. This bounded capacity our author shows, from ver. 232
to 384, betrays itself two ways: in its judgment both of the matter, and the
manner of the work criticised. Of the matter, in judging by parts, or in having
one favourite part to a neglect of all the rest. Of the manner, in confining
men's regard only to conceit, or language, or numbers. This is our poet's
order, and we shall follow him as it leads us, only just observing one general
beauty which runs through this part of the poem; it is,&mdash;that under each of
these heads of wrong judgment, he has intermixed excellent precepts for the
right. We shall take notice of them as they occur.</p>

<p>He exposes the folly of judging by parts very artfully, not by a direct
description of that sort of critic, but of his opposite, a perfect judge, &amp;c. Nor
is the elegance of this conversion less than the art; for as, in poetical <i>style</i>, one
word or figure is still put for another, in order to catch new lights from distant
images, and reflect them back upon the subject in hand, so in poetical
<i>matter</i> one person or description may be commodiously employed for another,
with the same advantage of representation. It is observable that our author
makes it almost the necessary consequence of judging by parts, to find fault:
and this not without much discernment: for the several parts of a complete whole,
when seen only singly, and known only independently, must always have the
appearance of irregularity,&mdash;often of deformity; because the poet's design being
to create a resultive beauty from the artful assemblage of several various parts
into one natural whole, those parts must be fashioned with regard to their
mutual relations in the stations they occupy in that whole, from whence the
beauty required is to arise; but that regard will occasion so unreducible a
form in each part, when considered singly, as to present a very mis-shapen
form.</p>

<p>Ver. 253. <i>Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see</i>,] He shows next, from
ver. 252 to 263, that to fix our censure on single parts, though they happen to
want an exactness consistent enough with their relation to the rest, is even
then very unjust: and for these reasons:&mdash;1. Because it implies an expectation
of a faultless piece, which is a vain fancy. 2. Because no more is to
be expected of any work than that it fairly attains its end. But the end may
be attained, and yet these trivial faults committed: therefore, in spite of such
faults, the work will merit that praise that is due to everything which attains
its end. 3. Because sometimes a great beauty is not to be procured, nor a
notorious blemish to be avoided, but by suffering one of these minute and
trivial errors. 4. And lastly, because the general neglect of them is a praise,
as it is the indication of a genius, attentive to greater matters.</p>

<p>Ver 263. <i>Most critics, fond of some subservient art, &amp;c.</i>] II. The second way
in which a narrow capacity, as it relates to the matter, shows itself, is judging
by a favourite part. The author has placed this, from ver. 262 to 285,
after the other of judging by parts, with great propriety, it being indeed a
natural consequence of it. For when men have once left the whole to turn
their attention to the separate parts, that regard and reverence due only to a
whole is fondly transferred to one or other of its parts. And thus we see,
that heroes themselves, as well as hero-makers, even kings, as well as poets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and critics, when they chance never to have had, or long to have lost the idea
of that which is the only legitimate object of their office, the care and conservation
of the whole, are wont to devote themselves to the service of some
favourite part, whether it be love of money, military glory, despotic power,
&amp;c. And all, as our author says on this occasion,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">to one loved folly sacrifice.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This general misconduct much recommends that maxim in good poetry and
politics, to give a principal attention to the whole,&mdash;a maxim which our author
has elsewhere shown to be equally true likewise in morals and religion, as
being founded in the order of things; for if we examine we shall find the
misconduct here complained of to arise from this imbecility of our nature,
that the mind must always have something to rest upon, to which the passions
and affections may be interestingly directed. Nature prompts us to
seek it in the most worthy objects; and reason points us to a whole, or
system: but the false lights which the passions hold out confound and dazzle
us: we stop short; and, before we get to a whole, take up with some part,
which thenceforth becomes our favourite.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ver. 285.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><i>Thus critics of less judgment than caprice,</i></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>Curious not knowing, not exact but nice,</i></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>Form short ideas, &amp;c.]</i></td></tr></table>

<p>2. He concludes his observations on those two sorts of judges by parts, with
this general reflection:&mdash;The curious not knowing are the first sort, who
judge by parts, and with a microscopic sight (as he says elsewhere) examine
bit by bit. The not exact but nice, are the second, who judge by a favourite
part, and talk of a whole to cover their fondness for a part, as philosophers do
of principles, in order to obtrude notions and opinions in their stead. But
the fate common to both is, to be governed by caprice and not by judgment,
and consequently to form short ideas, or to have ideas short of truth; though
the latter sort, through a fondness to their favourite part, imagine that it comprehends
the whole in epitome, as the famous hero of La Mancha, mentioned
just before, used to maintain, that knight errantry comprised within itself the
quintessence of all science, civil, military, and religious.</p>

<p>Ver. 289. <i>Some to conceit alone, &amp;c.</i>] We come now to that second sort
of bounded capacity, which betrays itself in its judgment on the manner of the
work criticised. And this our author prosecutes from ver. 288 to 384. These
are again subdivided into divers classes.</p>

<p>Ver. 289. <i>Some to conceit alone, &amp;c.</i>] The first, from ver. 288 to 305, are
those who confine their attention solely to conceit or wit. And here again the
critic by parts, offends doubly in the manner, just as he did in the matter;
for he not only confines his attention to a part, when it should be extended to
the whole, but he likewise judges falsely of that part. And this, as the other,
is unavoidable, the parts in the manner bearing the same close relation to the
whole, that the parts in the matter do; to which whole, the ideas of this
critic have never yet extended. Hence it is, that our author, speaking here of
those who confine their attention solely to conceit or wit, describes the distinct
species of true and false wit, because they not only mistake a wrong disposition
of true wit for a right, but likewise false wit for true. He describes false
wit first, from ver. 288 to 297,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
Some to conceit alone, &amp;c.,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>where the reader may observe our author's address in representing, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
description of false wit, the false disposition of the true; as the critic by parts
is apt to fall into both these errors.</p>

<p>He next describes true wit, from ver. 296 to 305,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
True wit is nature to advantage dressed, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And here again the reader may observe the same beauty; not only an explanation
of true wit, but likewise of the right disposition of it, which the poet
illustrates, as he did the wrong, by ideas taken from the art of painting, in
the theory of which he was exquisitely skilled.</p>

<p>Ver. 305. <i>Others for language, &amp;c.</i>] He proceeds secondly to those contracted
critics, whose whole concern turns upon language, and shows, from
ver. 304 to 337, that this quality, where it holds the principal place in a work,
deserves no commendation:&mdash;1. Because it excludes qualities more essential.
And when the abounding verbiage has choked and suffocated the sense, the
writer will be obliged to varnish over the mischief with all the false colouring
of eloquence. 2. Secondly, because the critic who busies himself with this
quality alone, is unable to make a right judgment of it; because true expression
is only the dress of thought, and so must be perpetually varied according
to the subject, and manner of treating it. But those who never concern themselves
with the sense, can form no judgment of the correspondence between
that and the language.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
Expression is the dress of thought, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears more decent, as more suitable, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now as these critics are ignorant of this correspondence, their whole judgment
in language is reduced to verbal criticism, or the examination of single words;
and generally those which are most to his taste, are (for an obvious reason) such
as smack most of antiquity, on which account our author has bestowed a little
raillery upon it; concluding with a short and proper direction concerning the
use of words, so far as regards their novelty and ancientry.</p>

<p>Ver. 337. <i>But most by numbers judge, &amp;c.</i>] The last sort are those, from
ver. 336 to 384, whose ears are attached only to the harmony of a poem. Of
which they judge as ignorantly and as perversely as the other sort did of the
eloquence, and for the same reason. Our author first describes that false
harmony with which they are so much captivated; and shows that it is
wretchedly flat and unvaried: for</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
Smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He then describes the true: 1. As it is in itself, constant; with a happy mixture
of strength and sweetness, in contradiction to the roughness and flatness
of false harmony: and 2. As it is varied in compliance to the subject, where
the sound becomes an echo to the sense, so far as is consistent with the preservation
of numbers, in contradiction to the monotony of false harmony. Of
this he gives us, in the delivery of his precepts, four beautiful examples of
smoothness, roughness, slowness, and rapidity. The first use of this correspondence
of the sound to the sense, is to aid the fancy in acquiring a perfecter
and more lively image of the thing represented. A second and nobler, is to
calm and subdue the turbulent and selfish passions, and to raise and warm the
beneficent, which he illustrates in the famous adventure of Timotheus and
Alexander, where, in referring to Mr. Dryden's Ode on that subject, he turns
it to a high compliment on his favourite poet.</p>


<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></div>

<p>Ver. 384. <i>Avoid extremes, &amp;c.</i>] Our author is now come to the last cause of
wrong judgment, partiality,&mdash;the parent of the immediately preceding cause,
a bounded capacity, nothing so much narrowing and contracting the mind as
prejudices entertained for or against things or persons. This, therefore, as
the main root of all the foregoing, he prosecutes at large, from ver. 383 to
474. First, to ver. 394, he previously exposes that capricious turn of mind,
which, by running into extremes, either of praise or dispraise, lays the foundation
of an habitual partiality. He cautions, therefore, both against one and
the other; and with reason; for excess of praise is the mark of a bad taste;
and excess of censure, of a bad digestion.</p>

<p>Ver. 394. <i>Some foreign writers, &amp;c.</i>] Having explained the disposition of
mind which produces an habitual partiality, he proceeds to expose this partiality
in all the shapes in which it appears both amongst the unlearned and
the learned.</p>

<p>I. In the unlearned it is seen, first, in an unreasonable fondness for, or
aversion to, our own or foreign, to ancient or modern writers. And as it is the
mob of unlearned readers he is here speaking of, he exposes their folly in a
very apposite similitude:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
Thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one small sect, and all are damned beside.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But he shows, from ver. 396 to 408, that these critics have as wrong notions
of reason as those bigots have of God; for that genius is not confined to
times or climates; but, as the common gift of nature, is extended throughout
all ages and countries; that indeed this intellectual light, like the material
light of the sun, may not shine at all times, and in every place with equal
splendour, but be sometimes clouded with popular ignorance, and sometimes
again eclipsed by the discountenance of the great; yet it shall still recover
itself, and, by breaking through the strongest of these impediments, manifest
the eternity of its nature.</p>

<p>Ver. 408. <i>Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own</i>,] A second instance
of unlearned partiality is (as he shows from ver. 407 to 424) men's going
always along with the cry, as having no fixed nor well-grounded principles
whereon to raise any judgment of their own. A third is reverence for names,
of which sort, as he well observes, the worst and vilest are the idolizers of
names of quality; whom therefore he stigmatises as they deserve. Our
author's temper as well as his judgment is here seen, in throwing this species
of partiality amongst the unlearned critics. His affection for letters would
not suffer him to conceive, that any learned critic could ever fall into so low a
prostitution.</p>

<p>Ver. 424. <i>The vulgar thus&mdash;As oft the learned</i>&mdash;] II. He comes in the
second place, from ver. 423 to 452, to consider the instances of partiality in
the learned. 1. The first is singularity. For, as want of principles, in the
unlearned, necessitates them to rest on the common judgment as always right,
so adherence to false principles (that is, to notions of their own) mislead the
learned into the other extreme of supposing the common judgment always
wrong. And as, before, our author compared those to bigots, who made true
faith to consist in believing after others, so he compares these to schismatics,
who make it to consist in believing as no one ever believed before, which folly
he marks with a lively stroke of humour in the turn of the thought:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So schismatics the plain believers quit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are but damned for having too much wit.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The second is novelty. And as this proceeds sometimes from fondness,
sometimes from vanity, he compares the one to the passion for a mistress, and
the other to the pride of being in fashion; but the excuse common to both is,
the daily improvement of their judgment:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ask them the cause; they're wiser still they say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now as this is a plausible pretence for their inconstancy, and our author has
himself afterwards approved of it, as a remedy against obstinacy and pride,
where he says, ver. 570,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But you with pleasure own your errors past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make each day a critique on the last,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>he has been careful, by the turn of the expression in this place, to show the
difference between the pretence and the remedy. For time, considered only
as duration, vitiates as frequently as it improves. Therefore to expect wisdom
as the necessary attendant of length of days, unrelated to long experience, is
vain and delusive. This he illustrates by a remarkable example, where we
see time, instead of becoming wiser, destroying good letters, to substitute
school divinity in their place; the genius of which kind of learning, the character
of its professors, and the fate, which, sooner or later, always attends
whatsoever is wrong or false, the poet sums up in those four lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
Faith, gospel, all, seemed made to be disputed, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And in conclusion he observes, that perhaps this mischief, from love of novelty,
might not be so great, did it not, along with the critic, infect the writer
likewise, who, when he finds his readers disposed to take ready wit on the
standard of current folly, never troubles himself to think of better payment.</p>

<p>Ver. 452. <i>Some valuing those of their own side or mind, &amp;c.</i>] 3. The third
and last instance of partiality in the learned, is party and faction, which is
considered from ver. 451 to 474, where he shows how men of this turn deceive
themselves, when they load a writer of their own side with commendation.
They fancy they are paying tribute to merit, when they are only sacrificing to
self-love. But this is not the worst. He further shows, that this party spirit
has often very ill effects on science itself, while, in support of faction, it
labours to depress some rising genius, that was, perhaps, raised by nature to
enlighten his age and country. By which he would insinuate, that all the
baser and viler passions seek refuge, and find support in party madness.</p>

<p>Ver. 474. <i>Be thou the first, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having now gone through the
last cause of wrong judgment, and the root of all the rest, partiality, and
ended his remarks upon it with a detection of the two rankest kinds, those
which arise out of party rage and envy, takes the occasion, which this affords
him, of closing his second division in the most graceful manner, from ver.
473 to 560, by concluding from the premises, and calling upon the true critic
to be careful of his charge, which is the protection and support of wit; for,
the defence of it from malevolent censure is its true protection, and the
illustration of its beauties, is its true support.</p>

<p>He first shows, the critic ought to do this service without loss of time, and
on these motives:&mdash;1. Out of regard to himself, for there is some merit in
giving the world notice of an excellence, but little or none, in pointing, like
an index, to the beaten road of admiration. 2. Out of regard to the poem,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
for the short duration of modern works requires that they should begin to
live betimes. He compares the life of modern wit (which in a changeable
dialect, must soon pass away), and that of the ancient (which survives in an
universal language), to the difference between the patriarchal age and our own,
and observes, that while the ancient writings live for ever, as it were, in brass
and marble, the modern are but like paintings, which, of how masterly a hand
soever, have no sooner gained their requisite perfection by the softening and
ripening of their tints, which they do in a very few years, but they begin to
fade and die away. 3. Lastly, our author shows that the critic ought in
justice to do this service out of regard to the poet, when he considers the
slender dowry the muse brings along with her. In youth it is only a vain
and short-lived pleasure; and in maturer years, an accession of care and
labour, in proportion to the weight of reputation to be sustained, and of the
increase of envy to be opposed: and therefore, concludes his reasoning on this
head with that pathetic and insinuating address to the critic, from ver. 508
to 526.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! let not learning, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 526. <i>But if in noble minds some dregs remain, &amp;c.</i>] So far as to what
ought to be the true critic's principal study and employment. But if the sour
critical humour abounds, and must therefore needs have vent, he directs to its
proper object, and shows, from ver. 525 to 556, how it may be innocently and
usefully pointed. This is very observable; our author had made spleen and
disdain the characteristic of the false critic, and yet here supposes them inherent
in the true. But it is done with judgment, and a knowledge of nature. For
as bitterness and astringency in unripe fruits of the best kind are the foundation
and capacity of that high spirit, race, and flavour which we find in them,
when perfectly concocted by the warmth and influence of the sun, and which,
without those qualities, would gain no more by that influence than only a
mellow insipidity, so spleen and disdain in the true critic, when improved by
long study and experience, ripen into an exactness of judgment and an elegance
of taste, although, in the false critic, lying remote from the influence of good
letters, they remain in all their first offensive harshness and acerbity. The poet
therefore shows how, after the exaltation of these qualities into their state of
perfection, the very dregs (which, though precipitated, may possibly, on some
occasions, rise and ferment even in a noble mind) may be usefully employed,
that is to say, in branding obscenity and impiety. Of these, he explains the
rise and progress, in a beautiful picture of the different geniuses of the two
reigns of Charles II. and William III. The former of which gave course to
the most profligate luxury; the latter to a licentious impiety. These are the
crimes our author assigns over to the caustic hand of the critic; but concludes
however, from ver. 555 to 560, with this necessary admonition, to take care
not to be misled into unjust censure, either on the one hand, by a pharisaical
niceness, or on the other by a self-consciousness of guilt. And thus the second
division of his Essay ends: the judicious conduct of which is worthy our
observation. The subjects of it are the causes of wrong judgment. These he
derives upwards from cause to cause, till he brings them to their source, an
immoral partiality: for as he had, in the first part,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
traced the Muses upward to their spring,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and shown them to be derived from heaven, and the offspring of virtue, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
hath he here pursued this enemy of the muses, the bad critic, to his low original,
in the arms of his nursing mother immorality. This order naturally
introduces, and at the same time shows the necessity of, the subject of the
third and last division, which is, on the morals of the critic.</p>

<p>Ver. 560. <i>Learn then, &amp;c.</i>] We enter now on the third part, the morals of
the critic. There seemed a peculiar necessity of inculcating precepts of this
sort to the critic, by reason of that native acerbity so often found in the profession;
of which, a short memorial will soon convince the reader, and at the
same time inform him why our author has here included all critical morals in
candour, modesty, and good breeding. When, in these latter ages, human
learning reared its head in the West, and its tail, verbal criticism, was of
course to rise with it, the madness of critics presently became so offensive,
that the sober stupidity of the monks might appear the more tolerable evil.
J. Argyropylus, a mercenary Greek, who came to teach school in Italy after
the sacking of Constantinople by the Turk, used to maintain that Cicero understood
neither philosophy nor Greek; while another of his countrymen, J. Lascaris
by name, threatened to demonstrate that Virgil was no poet. However,
these men raised in the west of Europe an appetite for the Greek language.
So that Hermolaus Barbarus, a noted critic and most passionate admirer of
it, used to boast that he had invoked and raised the devil, about the meaning
of the Aristotelian εντελεχεια. As this man was famous for his enchantments,
so one, whom Balzac speaks of, was as useful to letters by his revelations, and
was wont to say, that the meaning of such a verse in Persius, no one knew
but God and himself. But they were not all so modest. The celebrated
Pomponius Lætus, in excess of veneration for antiquity, became a real pagan,
raised altars to Romulus, and sacrificed to the gods of Greece. But if the
Greeks cried down Cicero, the Italian critics knew how to support his credit.
Every one has heard of the childish excesses into which the fondness for being
thought Ciceronians carried the most celebrated Italians of this time. They
generally abstained from reading the scripture for fear of spoiling their style,
and Cardinal Bembo used to call the epistles of St. Paul by the contemptuous
name of epistolaccias,&mdash;great overgrown epistles. But Erasmus cured this
frenzy in that masterpiece of good sense, entitled Ciceronianus, for which, as
lunatics treat their physicians, the elder Scaliger insulted him with all the
brutal fury peculiar to his family and profession. His son Joseph and Salmasius
had such endowments of art and nature as might have made them
public blessings; yet how did these savages tear and worry one another.
The choicest of Joseph's flowers of speech were <i>stercus diaboli</i>, and <i>lutum
stercore maceratum</i>. It is true these were strewn upon his enemies. He
treated his friends better; for in a letter to Thuanus, speaking of two of them,
Clavius and Lipsius, he calls the first "a monster of ignorance," and the
other "a slave to the Jesuits" and an "idiot." But so great was his love of
sacred amity, that he says, at the same time, "I still keep up a correspondence
with him, notwithstanding his idiotry, for it is my principle to be
constant in my friendships.&mdash;Je ne reste de lui écrire nonobstant son idioterie,
d'autant que je suis constant en amitié." The character he gives of his own
work, in the same letter, is no less extraordinary: "Vous vous pouvez
assurer que nostre Eusebe sera un tresor des merveilles de la doctrine
chronologique." But this modest account of his chronology is a trifle in comparison
of the just esteem Salmasius conceived of himself, as Mr. Colomies
tells the story: This critic one day meeting two of his brethren, Messrs.
Gaulmin and Maussac, in the royal library at Paris, Gaulmin, in a virtuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
consciousness of their importance, told the other two that he believed they
three could make head against all the learned in Europe. To which the
great Salmasius fiercely replied, "Do you and Mr. Maussac join yourselves to
all that is learned in the world, and you shall find that I alone am a match
for you all." Vossius tells us that, when Laur. Valla had snarled at every
name of the first order in antiquity, such as Aristotle, Cicero, and one whom
I should have thought this critic was likeliest to pass by, the redoubtable
Priscian, he impiously boasted that he had arms even against Christ himself.
But Codrus Urcæus went further, and actually used those arms the other only
threatened with. This man while he was preparing some trifling piece of
criticism for the press, had the misfortune to hear his papers were burned, on
which he is reported to have broke out, "Quodnam ego tantum scelus concepi,
O Christe; quem ego tuorum unquam læsi, ut ita inexpiabili in me odio debaccheris?
Audi ea, quæ tibi mentis compos et ex animo dicam. Si forte, cum ad
ultimam vitæ finem pervenero, supplex accedam ad te oratum, neve audias,
neve inter tuos accipias oro; cum infernis Diis in æternum vitam agere decrevi."
Whereupon, says my author, he quitted the converse of men, threw himself
into the thickest of a forest, and there wore out the wretched remains of life
in all the agonies of despair.</p>

<p>But to return to the poem. This third and last part is in two divisions.
In the first of which, from ver. 559 to 631, our author inculcates the morals
by precept. In the second, from ver. 630 to the end, by example. His first
precept, from ver. 561 to 566, recommends candour, for its use to the critic,
and to the writer criticised.</p>

<p>2. The second, from ver. 565 to 572, recommends modesty, which manifests
itself in these four signs: 1. Silence where it doubts,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Be silent always when you doubt your sense;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. A seeming diffidence where it knows,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. A free confession of error where wrong,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
But you with pleasure own your errors past;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>4. And a constant review and scrutiny even of those opinions which it still
thinks right.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
And make each day a critique on the last.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. The third, from ver. 571 to 584, recommends good-breeding, which will
not force truth dogmatically upon men, as ignorant of it, but gently insinuates
it to them, as not sufficiently attentive to it. But as men of breeding
are apt to fall into two extremes, he prudently cautions against them. The
one is a backwardness in communicating their knowledge, out of a false
delicacy, and for fear of being thought pedants: the other, and much more
common extreme, is a mean complaisance, which those who are worthy of your
advice do not need, to make it acceptable; for such can best bear reproof
in particular points, who best deserve commendation in general.</p>

<p>Ver. 584. <i>'Twere well might critics, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having thus recommended
in his general rules of conduct for the judgment, these three critical
virtues to the heart, shows next, from ver. 583 to 631, upon what three sorts
of writers these virtues, together with the advice conveyed under them, would
be thrown away; and which is worse, be repaid with obloquy and scorn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
These are the false critic, the dull man of quality, and the bad poet, each of
which species of incorrigible writers he hath very exactly painted. But
having drawn the last of them at full length, and being always attentive to
the two main branches of his subject, which are, of writing and judging well,
he re-assumes the character of the bad critic (whom he had touched upon
before), to contrast him with the other; and makes the characteristic common
to both, to be a never-ceasing repetition of their own impertinence.</p>

<p><i>The poet</i>&mdash;still runs on in a raging vein, &amp;c. ver. 606, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>The critic</i>&mdash;with his own tongue still edifies his ears, 614, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Than which there cannot be an observation more just, or more grounded on
experience.</p>

<p>Ver. 631. <i>But where's the man, &amp;c.</i>] II. The second division of this last
part, which we now come to, is of the morals of critics, by example. For,
having in the first, drawn a picture of the false critic, at large, he breaks
out into an apostrophe, containing an exact and finished character of the true,
which, at the same time, serves for an easy and proper introduction to this
second division. For having asked, from ver. 630 to 643, <i>Where's the man,
&amp;c.</i>, he answers, from ver. 642 to 681, that he was to be found in the happier
ages of Greece and Rome; in the characters of Aristotle and Horace,
Dionysius and Petronius, Quintilian and Longinus, whose several excellencies
he has not only well distinguished, but has contrasted them with a peculiar
elegance. The profound science and logical method of Aristotle is opposed to
the plain common sense of Horace, conveyed in a natural and familiar negligence;
the study and refinement of Dionysius, to the gay and courtly ease of
Petronius; and the gravity and minuteness of Quintilian, to the vivacity and
general topics of Longinus. Nor has the poet been less careful in these
examples, to point out their eminence in the several critical virtues he so
carefully inculcated in his precepts. Thus in Horace he particularizes his
candour; in Petronius, his good-breeding; in Quintilian, his free and
copious instruction; and in Longinus, his great and noble spirit.</p>

<p>Ver. 681. <i>Thus long succeeding critics, &amp;c.</i>] The next period in which the
true critic, he tells us, appeared, was at the revival and restoration of letters
in the West. This occasions his giving a short history, from ver. 682 to 709,
of the decline and re-establishment of arts and sciences in Italy. He shows
that they both fell under the same enemy, despotic power; and that when
both had made some little efforts to recover themselves, they were soon again
overwhelmed by a second deluge of another kind, namely, superstition; and a
calm of dulness finished upon Rome and letters what the rage of barbarism
had begun:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A second deluge learning thus o'er-run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the monk finished what the Goth begun.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When things had long remained in this condition, and all hopes of recovery
now seemed desperate, it was a critic, our author shows us, for the honour of
the art he here teaches, who at length broke the charm of dulness, who dissipated
the enchantment, and, like another Hercules, drove those cowled and
hooded serpents from the Hesperian tree of knowledge, which they had so
long guarded from human approach.</p>

<p>Ver. 697. <i>But see! each Muse, in Leo's golden days</i>,] This presents us
with the second period in which the true critic appeared, of whom he has
given us a complete idea in the single example of Marcus Hieronymus Vida;
for his subject being poetical criticism, for the use principally of a critical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
poet, his example is an eminent poetical critic, who had written of the Art of
Poetry in verse.</p>

<p>Ver. 709. <i>But soon by impious arms, &amp;c.</i>] This brings us to the third
period, after learning had travelled still further West, when the arms of the
Emperor, in the sack of Rome by the Duke of Bourbon, had driven it out of
Italy, and forced it to pass the mountains. The examples he gives in this
period, are of Boileau in France, and of the Lord Roscommon and the Duke
of Buckingham in England: and these were all poets, as well as critics
in verse. It is true, the last instance is of one who was no eminent poet, the
late Mr. Walsh. This small deviation might be well overlooked, were it only
for its being a pious office to the memory of his friend. But it may be
further justified, as it was an homage paid in particular to the morals of the
critic, nothing being more amiable than the character here drawn of this
excellent person. He being our author's judge and censor, as well as friend,
it gives him a graceful opportunity to add himself to the number of the later
critics; and with a character of his own genius and temper sustained by that
modesty and dignity which it is so difficult to make consistent, this performance
concludes.</p>

<p>I have here given a short and plain account of the Essay on Criticism, concerning
which, I have but one thing more to say, that when the reader
considers the regularity of the plan, the masterly conduct of each part, the
penetration into nature, and the compass of learning so conspicuous throughout,
he should at the same time know, it was the work of an author who had
not attained the twentieth year of his age.</p>


<h3><span class="em1point53">
NOTES.</span></h3>

<p>Ver. 28. <i>In search of wit, these lose their common sense</i>,] This observation
is extremely just. Search of wit is not only the occasion, but the efficient
cause of the loss of common sense; for wit consisting in choosing out, and
setting together such ideas from whose assemblage pleasant pictures may be
drawn on the fancy, the judgment, through an habitual search of wit, loses,
by degrees, its faculty of seeing the true relation of things; in which consists
the exercise of common sense.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><i>All fools have still an itching to deride,</i></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>And fain would lie upon the laughing side.</i>]</td></tr></table>

<p>The sentiment is just, and if Hobbes's account of laughter be true, that it
arises from a silly pride, we see the reason of it. The expression too is fine;
it alludes to the condition of idiots and natural fools, who are observed to be
ever on the grin.</p>

<p>Ver. 43. <i>Their generation's so equivocal.</i>] It is sufficient that a principle of
philosophy has been generally received, whether it be true or false, to justify
a poet's use of it to set off his wit. But to recommend his argument, he
should be cautious how he uses any but the true; for falsehood, when it is
set too near the truth, will tarnish what it should brighten up. Besides, the
analogy between natural and moral truth makes the principles of true philosophy
the fittest for this use. Our poet has been pretty careful in observing
this rule.</p>

<p>Ver. 51. <i>And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.</i>] Besides the
peculiar sense explained in the comment, the words have still a more general
meaning, and caution us against going on, when our ideas begin to grow
obscure, as we are then most apt to do, though that obscurity be an admonition
that we should leave off, for it arises, either from our small acquaintance
with the subject, or the incomprehensibility of its nature, in which circumstances
a genius will always write as badly as a dunce. An observation well
worth the attention of all profound writers.</p>

<tr><td></td><td><i>Where beams of warm imagination play,</i></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>The memory's soft figures melt away.</i>]</td></tr></table>

<p>These observations are collected from an intimate knowledge of human
nature. The cause of that languor and heaviness in the understanding,
which is almost inseparable from a very strong and tenacious memory, seems
to be a want of the proper exercise of that faculty, the understanding being
in a great measure unactive, while the memory is cultivating. As to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
other appearance, the decay of memory by the vigorous exercise of fancy, the
poet himself seems to have intimated the cause of it in the epithet he has
given to the imagination. For if, according to the atomic philosophy, the
memory of things be preserved in a chain of ideas, produced by the animal
spirits moving in continued trains, the force and rapidity of the imagination,
breaking and dissipating the links of this chain by forming new associations,
must necessarily weaken, and disorder the recollective faculties.</p>

<p>Ver. 67. <i>Would all but stoop to what they understand.</i>] The expression is
delicate, and implies what is very true, that most men think it a degradation
of their genius to employ it in what lies level to their comprehension, but had
rather exercise their talents in the ambition of subduing what is placed
above it.</p>

<p>Ver. 80. <i>Some, to whom heaven, &amp;c.</i>] Here the poet (in a sense he was not, at
first, aware of) has given an example of the truth of his observation, in the
observation itself. The two lines stood originally thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
There are whom heav'n has blest with store of wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet want as much again to manage it.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the first line, wit is used, in the modern sense, for the effort of fancy; in
the second line it is used in the ancient sense, for the result of judgment.
This trick, played the reader, he endeavoured to keep out of sight, by altering
the lines as they now stand,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Some, to whom heav'n in wit has been profuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Want as much more, to turn it to its use.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For the words, "to manage it," as the lines were at first, too plainly discovered
the change put upon the reader, in the use of the word "wit." This is now a
little covered by the latter expression of "turn it to its use." But then the
alteration, in the preceding line, from "store of wit," to "profuse," was an
unlucky change. For though he who has "store of wit" may want more, yet
he to whom it was given in "profusion" could hardly be said to want more.
The truth is, the poet had said a lively thing, and would, at all hazards,
preserve the reputation of it, though the very topic he is upon obliged him to
detect the imposition, in the very next lines, which show he meant two very
different things, by the very same term, in the two preceding:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For wit and judgment often are at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 88. <i>Those rules of old, &amp;c.</i>] Cicero has, best of any one I know, explained
what that thing is which reduces the wild and scattered parts of
human knowledge into arts. "Nihil est quod ad artem redigi possit, nisi ille
prius, qui illa tenet, quorum artem instituere vult, habeat illam scientiam, ut ex
iis rebus, quarum ars nondum sit, artem efficere possit.&mdash;Omnia fere, quæ sunt
conclusa nunc artibus, dispersa et dissipata quondam fuerunt, ut in musicis,
&amp;c. Adhibita est igitur ars quædam extrinsecus ex alio genere quodam, quod
sibi totum <span class="smcap">Philosophi</span> assumunt, quæ rem dissolutam divulsamque conglutinaret,
et ratione quadam constringeret." De Orat. l. i. c. 41, 42.</p>

<p>Ver. 112, 114. <i>Some on the leaves&mdash;Some dryly plain.</i>] The first are the apes
of those learned Italian critics who at the restoration of letters, having found
the classic writers miserably deformed by the hands of monkish librarians,
very commendably employed their pains and talents in restoring them to
their native purity. The second, the plagiarists from the French critics, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
had made some admirable commentaries on the ancient critics. But that
acumen and taste, which separately constitute the distinct value of those two
species of Italian and French criticism, make no part of the character of these
paltry mimics at home described by our poet in the following lines,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
These leave the sense, their learning to display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those explain the meaning quite away.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Which species is the least hurtful, the poet has enabled us to determine in the

<p>From whence we conclude that the Reverend Mr. Upton was much more
innocently employed, when he quibbled upon Epictetus, than when he commented

<p>Ver. 150. <i>Thus Pegasus, &amp;c.</i>] We have observed how the precepts for
writing and judging are interwoven throughout the whole poem. The
sublime flight of a poet is first described, soaring above all vulgar bounds, to
snatch a grace directly which lies beyond the reach of a common adventurer;
and afterwards, the effect of that grace upon the true critic; whom it penetrates
with an equal rapidity, going the nearest way to his heart, without
passing through his judgment. By which is not meant that it could not stand
the test of judgment; but that, as it was a beauty uncommon, and above rule,
and the judgment habituated to determine only by rule, it makes its direct
appeal to the heart, which, when once gained, soon brings over the judgment,
whose concurrence (it being now enlarged and set above forms) is easily procured.
That this is the poet's sublime conception appears from the concluding
words:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
And all its end at once attains.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For poetry doth not attain all its end, till it hath gained the judgment as
well as heart.</p>

<p>A very sensible French writer makes the following remark on this species of
pride: "Un homme qui sçait plusieurs langues, qui entend les auteurs grecs
et latins, qui s'élève même jusqu'à la dignité de scholiaste; si cet homme
venoit à peser son véritable mérite, il trouveroit souvent qu'il se réduit avoir
eu des yeux et de la mémoire; il se garderoit bien de donner le nom respectable
de science à une érudition sans lumière. Il y a une grande différence
entre s'enrichir des mots ou des choses, entre alléguer des autorités ou des
raisons. Si un homme pouvoit se surprendre à n'avoir que cette sorte de
mérite, il en rougiroit plutôt que d'en être vain."</p>

</td></tr></table>


<p>The second line, in apologizing for those faults which the first says should
be overlooked, gives the reason of the precept. For when a great writer's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
attention is fixed on a general view of nature, and his imagination becomes
warmed with the contemplation of great ideas, it can hardly be, but that there
must be small irregularities in the disposition both of matter and style, because
the avoiding these requires a coolness of recollection, which a writer so
qualified and so busied is not master of.</p>

<p>Ver. 248. <i>The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!</i>] The Pantheon
I would suppose; perhaps St. Peter's; no matter which; the observation is
true of both. There is something very Gothic in the taste and judgment of a
learned man, who despises the masterpiece of art, the Pantheon, for those
very qualities which deserve our admiration. "Nous esmerveillons comme
l'on fait si grand cas de ce Pantheon, veu que son edifice n'est de si grande
industrie comme l'on crie: car chaque petit masson peut bien concevoir la
maniere de sa façon tout en un instant: car estant la base si massive, et les
murailles si espaisses, ne nous a semblé difficile d'y adjouster la vonte à claire
voye."&mdash;Pierre Belon's Observations, &amp;c. The nature of the Gothic structures
apparently led him into this mistake of the architectonic art in general;
that the excellency of it consists in raising the greatest weight on the least
assignable support, so that the edifice should have strength without the
appearance of it, in order to excite admiration. But to a judicious eye such a
building would have a contrary effect, the appearance (as our poet expresses
it) of a monstrous height, or breadth, or length. Indeed, did the just proportions
in regular architecture take off from the grandeur of a building, by all
the single parts coming united to the eye, as this learned traveller seems
to insinuate, it would be a reasonable objection to those rules on which this
masterpiece of art was constructed. But it is not so. The poet tells us
truly,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
The whole at once is bold, and regular.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 267. <i>Once on a time, &amp;c.</i>] This tale is so very apposite, that one
would naturally take it to be of the poet's own invention; and so much in
the spirit of Cervantes, that we might easily mistake it for one of the chief
beauties of that incomparable satire. Yet, in truth it is neither; but a story
taken by our author from the spurious Don Quixote, which shows how proper
an use may be made of general reading, when if there be but one good thing in
a book (as in that wretched performance there scarce was more) it may be
picked out, and employed to an excellent purpose.</p>

<p>Ver. 285. <i>Thus critics, &amp;c.</i>] In these two lines the poet finely describes
the way in which bad writers are wont to imitate the qualities of good ones.
As true judgment generally draws men out of popular opinions, so he who
cannot get from the crowd by the assistance of this guide, willingly follows
caprice, which will be sure to lead him into singularities. Again, true knowledge
is the art of treasuring up only that which, from its use in life, is worthy
of being lodged in the memory, and this makes the philosopher; but curiosity
consists in a vain attention to every thing out of the way, and which for its
inutility the world least regards, and this makes the antiquarian. Lastly,
exactness is the just proportion of parts to one another, and their harmony in
a whole; but he who has not extent of capacity for the exercise of this quality,
contents himself with nicety, which is a busying oneself about points and
syllables, and this makes the grammarian.</p>

<p>Ver. 297. <i>True wit is nature to advantage dressed, &amp;c.</i>] This definition is
very exact. Mr. Locke had defined wit to consist "in the assemblage of
ideas, and putting those together, with quickness and variety, wherein can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
be found any resemblance or congruity, whereby to make up pleasant pictures
and agreeable visions in the fancy." But that great philosopher, in separating
wit from judgment, as he does in this place, has given us (and he could therefore
give us no other) only an account of wit in general, in which false wit,
though not every species of it, is included. A striking image, therefore, of
nature is, as Mr. Locke observes, certainly wit; but this image may strike on
several other accounts, as well as for its truth and beauty, and the philosopher
has explained the manner how. But it never becomes that wit which is the
ornament of true poesy, whose end is to represent nature, but when it dresses
that nature to advantage, and presents her to us in the brightest and most
amiable light. And to know when the fancy has done its office truly, the
poet subjoins this admirable test, viz. When we perceive that it gives us back
the image of our mind. When it does that, we may be sure it plays no
tricks with us; for this image is the creature of the judgment, and whenever
wit corresponds with judgment, we may safely pronounce it to be true.</p>

<p>Ver. 311. <i>False eloquence, &amp;c.</i>] This simile is beautiful. For the false
colouring given to objects by the prismatic glass is owing to its untwisting,
by its obliquities, those threads of light which nature had put together, in
order to spread over its work an ingenious and simple candour, that should
not hide but only heighten the native complexion of the objects. And false
expression is nothing else but the straining and divaricating the parts of true
expression; and then daubing them over with what the rhetoricians very
properly term colours, in lieu of that candid light, now lost, which was
reflected from them in their natural state, while sincere and entire.</p>

<tr><td><i>The sound must seem an echo to the sense.</i></td></tr></table>

<p>The judicious introduction of this precept is remarkable. The poets, and even
some of the best of them, have been so fond of the beauty arising from this
trivial observance, that their practice has violated the very end of the precept,
which is the increase of harmony; and so they could but raise an echo, did
not care whose ears they offended by its dissonance. To remedy this abuse
therefore, our poet, by the introductory line, would insinuate, that harmony
is always to be presupposed as observed, though it may and ought to be perpetually
varied, so as to produce the effect here recommended.</p>

<p>Ver. 365. <i>The sound must seem an echo to the sense.</i>] Lord Roscommon says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
The sound is still a comment to the sense.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>They are both well expressed, although so differently; for Lord Roscommon
is showing how the sense is assisted by the sound; Mr. Pope, how the sound
is assisted by the sense.</p>

<p>Ver. 402. <i>Which, from the first, &amp;c.</i>] Genius is the same in all ages; but its
fruits are various, and more or less excellent as they are checked or matured
by the influence of government or religion upon them. Hence in some parts
of literature the ancients excel; in others, the moderns, just as those accidental
circumstances occurred.</p>

<p>Ver. 444. <i>Scotists.</i>] So denominated from Johannes Duns Scotus.
Erasmus tells us, an eminent Scotist assured him, that it was impossible to
understand one single proposition of this famous Duns, unless you had his
whole metaphysics by heart. This hero of incomprehensible fame suffered a
miserable reverse at Oxford in the time of Henry VIII. That grave antiquary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Mr. Antony Wood (in the vindication of himself and his writings from
the reproaches of the Bishop of Salisbury), sadly laments the deformation, as
he calls it, of that university, by the King's commissioners; and even records
the blasphemous speeches of one of them, in his own words: "We have set
Duns in Boccardo, with all his blind glossers, fast nailed up upon posts in all
common houses of easement." Upon which our venerable antiquary thus
exclaims: "If so be, the commissioners had such disrespect for that most
famous author, J. Duns, who was so much admired by our predecessors, and
so difficult to be understood, that the doctors of those times, namely, Dr.
William Roper, Dr. John Keynton, Dr. William Mowse, &amp;c. professed that,
in twenty-eight years' study, they could not understand him rightly, what
then had they for others of inferior note?" What indeed! But if so be, that
most famous J. Duns was so difficult to be understood (for that this is a most
theologic proof of his great worth is past all doubt), I should conceive our
good old antiquary to be a little mistaken, and that the nailing up this
Proteus of the schools was done by the commissioners in honour of the most
famous Duns, there being no other way of catching the sense of so slippery
and dodging an author, who had eluded the pursuit of three of their most
renowned doctors in full cry after him, for eight and twenty years together.
And this Boccardo in which he was confined, seemed very fit for the purpose,
it being observed that men are never more serious and thoughtful than in that
place of retirement.&mdash;Scribl.</p>

<p>Ver. 444. <i>Thomists</i>,] From Thomas Aquinas, a truly great genius, who,
in those blind ages, was the same in theology, that our Friar Bacon was in
natural philosophy; less happy than our countryman in this, that he soon
became surrounded with a number of dark glossers, who never left him till
they had extinguished the radiance of that light, which had pierced through
the thickest night of monkery, the thirteenth century, when the Waldenses
were suppressed, and Wickliffe not yet risen.</p>

<p>Ver. 445. <i>Amidst their kindred cobwebs.</i>] Were common sense disposed to
credit any of the monkish miracles of the dark and blind ages of the church,
it would certainly be one of the seventh century recorded by honest Bale.
"In the sixth general council," says he, "holden at Constantinople, Anno Dom
680, contra Monothelitas, where the Latin mass was first approved, and the
Latin ministers deprived of their lawful wives, spiders' webs, in wonderfull
copye were seen falling down from above, upon the heads of the people, to the
marvelous astonishment of many." The justest emblem and prototype of
school metaphysics, the divinity of Scotists and Thomists, which afterwards
fell, in wonderfull copye on the heads of the people, in support of
transubstantiation, to the marvelous astonishment of many, as it continues
to do to this day.</p>

<p>Ver. 450. <i>And authors think, &amp;c.</i>] This is an admirable satire on those
called authors in fashion, the men who get the laugh on their side. He shows
on how pitiful a basis their reputation stands,&mdash;the changeling disposition of
fools to laugh, who are always carried away with the last joke.</p>

<p>Ver. 463. <i>Milbourn</i>] The Rev. Mr. Luke Milbourn. Dennis served Mr.
Pope in the same office. But these men are of all times, and rise up on all
occasions. Sir Walter Raleigh had Alexander Ross; Chillingworth had
Cheynel; Milton a first Edwards; and Locke a second; neither of them
related to the third Edwards of Lincoln's Inn. They were divines of parts
and learning: this a critic without one or the other. Yet (as Mr. Pope says
of Luke Milbourn) the fairest of all critics; for having written against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
editor's remarks on Shakspear, he did him justice in printing, at the same
time, some of his own.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Ver. 468. <i>For envied wit, &amp;c.</i>] This similitude implies a fact too often
verified; and of which we need not seek abroad for examples. It is this, that
frequently those very authors, who have at first done all they could to obscure
and depress a rising genius, have at length been reduced to borrow from him,
imitate his manner, and reflect what they could of his splendour, merely to
keep themselves in some little credit. Nor hath the poet been less artful, to
insinuate what is sometimes the cause. A youthful genius, like the sun
rising towards the meridian, displays too strong and powerful beams for the
dirty temper of inferior writers, which occasions their gathering, condensing,
and blackening. But as he descends from the meridian (the time when the
sun gives its gilding to the surrounding clouds) his rays grow milder, his heat
more benign, and then</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i4">
 ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflect new glories, and augment the day.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>484. <i>So when, &amp;c.</i>] This similitude from painting, in which our author
discovers (as he always does on that subject) real science, has still a more
peculiar beauty, as at the same time that it confesses the just superiority of
ancient writings, it insinuates one advantage the modern have above them,
which is this, that in these latter, our more intimate acquaintance with the
occasion of writing, and with the manners described, lets us into those living
and striking graces which may be well compared to that perfection of imitation
given only by the pencil, while the ravages of time, amongst the monuments
of former ages, have left us but the gross substance of ancient wit,&mdash;so much
only of the form and fashion of bodies as may be expressed in brass or
marble.</p>

<p>Ver. 507.&mdash;<i>by knaves undone!</i>] By which the poet would insinuate a
common but shameful truth, that men in power, if they got into it by
illiberal arts, generally left wit and science to starve.</p>

<p>Ver. 545. <i>Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;</i>] The seeds of this
religious evil, as well as of the political good from whence it sprung (for good
and evil are incessantly arising out of one another) were sown in the preceding
fat age of pleasure. The mischiefs done during Cromwell's usurpation, by fanaticism,
inflamed by erroneous and absurd notions of the doctrine of grace and
satisfaction, made the loyal latitudinarian divines (as they were called) at the
restoration, go so far into the other extreme of resolving all Christianity into
morality, as to afford an easy introduction to socinianism, which in that reign
(founded on the principles of liberty) men had full opportunity of propagating.</p>

<p>Ver. 561. <i>For 'tis but half a judge's task, to know.</i>] The critic acts in two
capacities, of assessor and of judge: in the first, science alone is sufficient;
but the other requires morals likewise.</p>

<p>Ver. 631. <i>But where's the man, &amp;c.</i>] The poet, by his manner of asking
after this character, and telling us, when he had described it, that such once
were critics, does not encourage us to search for it amongst modern writers.
And indeed the discovery of him, if it could be made, would be but an
invidious affair. However, I will venture to name the piece of criticism in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
which all these marks may be found. It is entitled, Q. Hor. Fl. Ars Poetica,
et ejusd. Ep. ad Aug. with an English Commentary and Notes.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Ver. 642. <i>with reason on his side?</i>] Not only on his side, but in actual
employment. The critic makes but a mean figure, who when he has found out
the beauties of his author, contents himself with showing them to the world in
only empty exclamations. His office is to explain their nature, show from
whence they arise, and what effects they produce, or in the better and fuller
expression of the poet,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
To teach the world with reason to admire.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 652. <i>Who conquered nature, &amp;c.</i>] By this we must not understand
physical nature, but moral. The force of the observation consists in giving it
this sense. The poet not only uses the word nature, for human nature,
throughout this poem; but also, where in the beginning of it, he lays down
the principles of the arts he treats of, he makes the knowledge of human
nature the foundation of all criticism and poetry. Nor is the observation less
true than apposite. For Aristotle's natural inquiries were superficial and ill
made, though extensive; but his logical and moral works are supremely
excellent. In his moral, he has unfolded the human mind, and laid open all
the recesses of the heart and understanding; and in his logical, he has not
only conquered nature, but by his categories, has kept her in tenfold chains;
not as dulness kept the muses in the Dunciad, to silence them; but as
Aristæus held Proteus in Virgil, to deliver oracles.</p>

<p>Ver. 665. <i>See Dionysius, &amp;c.</i>] In the first of these lines, on which the
other depends, the peculiar excellence of this critic, and indeed the most
material and useful part of a critic's office, is touched upon, who, like the
refiner, purifies the rich ore of an original writer; for such a one busied in
creating, often neglects to separate and refine the mass, pouring out his riches
rather in bullion than in sterling.</p>

<p>Ver. 667. <i>Fancy and art, &amp;c.</i>] "The chief merit of Petronius," says an
objector,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> "is that of telling a story with grace and ease." But the poet is
not here speaking, nor was it his purpose to speak, of the chief merit of
Petronius, but of his merit as a critic, which consisted, he tells us, in softening
the art of a scholar with the ease of a courtier, and whoever reads and
understands the critical part of his abominable story-telling will see that the
poet has given his true character as a critic, which was the only thing he had
to do with.</p>

<p>Ver. 693. <i>At length Erasmus, &amp;c.</i>] Nothing can be more artful than the
application of this example, or more happy than the turn of the compliment.
To throw glory quite round the character of this admirable person, he makes
it to be (as in fact it really was) by his assistance chiefly, that Leo was
enabled to restore letters and the fine arts in his pontificate.</p>

<p>Ver. 694. <i>The glory of the priesthood and the shame!</i>] Our author elsewhere
lets us know what he esteems to be the glory of the priesthood as well
as of a christian in general, where comparing himself
to Erasmus, he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">

In moderation placing all my glory,
<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">
[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>and consequently what he regards as the shame of it. The whole of this
character belonged eminently and almost solely to Erasmus: for the other reformers,
such as Luther, Calvin, and their followers, understood so little in what
true christian liberty consisted, that they carried with them, into the
reformed churches, that very spirit of persecution, which had driven them
from the church of Rome.</p>

<p>Ver. 696. <i>And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.</i>] In this attack on the
established ignorance of the times, Erasmus succeeded so well as to bring
good letters into fashion, to which he gave new splendour, by preparing for
the press correct editions of many of the best ancient writers, both ecclesiastical
and profane. But having laughed and shamed his age out of one folly,
he had the mortification of seeing it run headlong into another. The virtuosi
of Italy, in a superstitious dread of that monkish barbarity which he had so
severely handled, would use no term (for now almost every man was become
a Latin writer), not even when they treated of the highest mysteries of religion,
which had not been consecrated in the capitol, and dispensed unto them from
the sacred hand of Cicero. Erasmus observed the growth of this classical folly
with the greater concern, as he discovered under all their attention to the
language of old Rome, a certain fondness for its religion, in a growing impiety
which disposed them to think irreverently of the christian faith. And he no
sooner discovered it than he set upon reforming it; which he did so effectually
in the dialogue, entitled Ciceronianus, that he brought the age back to
that just temper, which he had been all his life endeavouring to mark out to
it,&mdash;purity, but not pedantry in letters, and zeal, but not bigotry, in religion.
In a word, by employing his great talents of genius and literature on subjects
of general importance; and by opposing the extremes of all parties in their
turns; he completed the real character of a true critic and an honest man.</p>

had lived so long in great friendship before. A common acquaintance,
and well-wisher to both, desired me to write a poem to make
a jest of it, and laugh them together again. It was with this view
that I wrote the Rape of the Lock, which was well received, and
had its effect in the two families. Nobody but Sir George Brown
was angry, and he was a good deal so, and for a long time. He
could not bear that Sir Plume should talk nothing but nonsense.
Copies of the poem got about, and it was like to be printed, on
which I published the first draught of it (without the machinery) in
a Miscellany of Tonson's. The machinery was added afterwards to
make it look a little more considerable, and the scheme of adding it
was much liked and approved of by several of my friends, and particularly
by Dr. Garth, who, as he was one of the best natured men in
the world, was very fond of it. The making the machinery, and
what was published before, hit so well together is, I think, one of
the greatest proofs of judgment of anything I ever did.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope</span> in
<span class="smcap">Spence</span>.</p>

<p>It appears by the motto "Nolueram," etc., that the following
poem was written or published at the lady's request. But there are
some further circumstances not unworthy relating. Mr. Caryll (a
gentleman who was secretary to Queen Mary, wife of James II.,
whose fortunes he followed into France, author of the comedy of Sir
Solomon Single, and of several translations in Dryden's Miscellanies)
originally proposed the subject to him, in a view of putting an end,
by this piece of ridicule, to a quarrel that was risen between two
noble families, those of Lord Petre and of Mrs. Fermor, on the trifling
occasion of his having cut off a lock of her hair. The author sent it
to the lady, with whom he was acquainted; and she took it so well
as to give about copies of it. That first sketch, we learn from one of
his letters, was written in less than a fortnight, in 1711, in two
cantos only, and it was so printed; first, in a Miscellany of Bern.
Lintot's, without the name of the author. But it was received so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
well, that he made it more considerable the next year by the addition
of the machinery of the sylphs, and extended it to five cantos. We
shall give the reader the pleasure of seeing in what manner these
additions were inserted, so as to seem not to be added, but to grow
out of the poem. See Notes, Cant. I. ver. 9, etc. This insertion he
always esteemed, and justly, the greatest effort of his skill and art as
a poet.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton</span>.</p>

<p>I hope it will not be thought an exaggerated panegyric to say that
the Rape of the Lock is the best satire extant; that it contains the
truest and liveliest picture of modern life; and that the subject is
of a more elegant nature, as well as more artfully conducted than
that of any other heroi-comic poem. If some of the most candid
among the French critics begin to acknowledge that they have produced
nothing, in point of sublimity and majesty, equal to the
Paradise Lost, we may also venture to affirm that in point of
delicacy, elegance, and fine-turned raillery, on which they have so
much valued themselves, they have produced nothing equal to the
Rape of the Lock. It is in this composition Pope principally appears
a poet, in which he has displayed more imagination than in all his
other works taken together. It should, however, be remembered,
that he was not the first former and creator of those beautiful
machines, the sylphs, on which his claim to imagination is chiefly
founded. He found them existing ready to his hand; but has,
indeed, employed them with singular judgment and artifice.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton</span>.</p>

<p>The Rape of the Lock is the most airy, the most ingenious, and
the most delightful of all Pope's compositions. At its first appearance
it was termed by Addison "merum sal." Pope, however, saw
that it was capable of improvement; and having luckily contrived to
borrow his machinery from the Rosicrucians, imparted the scheme,
with which his head was teeming, to Addison, who told him that his
work, as it stood, was "a delicious little thing," and gave him no
encouragement to retouch it. This has been too hastily considered
as an instance of Addison's jealousy; for as he could not guess the
conduct of the new design, or the possibilities of pleasure comprised
in a fiction of which there had been no examples, he might very
reasonably and kindly persuade the author to acquiesce in his own
prosperity, and forbear an attempt which he considered as an unnecessary
hazard. Addison's counsel was happily rejected. Pope
foresaw the future efflorescence of imagery then budding in his mind,
and resolved to spare no art or industry of cultivation. The soft
luxuriance of his fancy was already shooting, and all the gay varieties
of diction were ready at his hand to colour and embellish it. His
attempt was justified by its success. The Rape of the Lock stands
forward, in the classes of literature, as the most exquisite example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of ludicrous poetry. Berkeley congratulated him upon the display
of powers more truly poetical than he had shown before. With
elegance of description and justness of precepts he had now exhibited
boundless fertility of invention. He always considered the intermixture
of the machinery with the action as his most successful
exertion of poetical art. He indeed could never afterwards produce
anything of such unexampled excellence. Those performances which
strike with wonder are combinations of skilful genius with happy
casualty; and it is not likely that any felicity, like the discovery of
a new race of preternatural agents, should happen twice to the same
man.</p>

<p>Of this poem the author was, I think, allowed to enjoy the praise
for a long time without disturbance. Many years afterwards Dennis
published some remarks upon it with very little force and with no
effect; for the opinion of the public was already settled, and it was
no longer at the mercy of criticism.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>To the praises which have been accumulated on the Rape of the
Lock by readers of every class, from the critic to the waiting-maid,
it is difficult to make any addition. Of that which is universally
allowed to be the most attractive of all ludicrous compositions, let it
rather be now inquired from what sources the power of pleasing is
derived. Dr. Warburton, who excelled in critical perspicacity, has
remarked that the preternatural agents are very happily adapted to
the purposes of the poem. The heathen deities can no longer gain
attention: we should have turned away from a contest between
Venus and Diana. The employment of allegorical persons always
excites conviction of its own absurdity; they may produce effects,
but cannot conduct actions: when the phantom is put in motion it
dissolves. Thus Discord may raise a mutiny, but Discord cannot
conduct a march, nor besiege a town. Pope brought in view a new
race of beings, with powers and passions proportionate to their
operation. The sylphs and gnomes act at the toilet and the tea-table,
what more terrific and more powerful phantoms perform on
the stormy ocean or the field of battle; they give their proper help

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and do their proper mischief. Pope is said by an objector,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> not to
have been the inventor of this petty nation; a charge which might
with more justice have been brought against the author of the Iliad,
who doubtless adopted the religious system of his country; for what
is there but the names of his agents which Pope has not invented?
Has he not assigned them characters and operations never heard of
before? Has he not, at least, given them their first poetical
existence? If this is not sufficient to denominate his work original,
nothing original ever can be written.</p>

<p>In this work are exhibited, in a very high degree, the two most
engaging powers of an author. New things are made familiar, and
familiar things are made new. A race of aerial people, never heard
of before, is presented to us in a manner so clear and easy, that the
reader seeks for no further information, but immediately mingles
with his new acquaintance, adopts their interests, and attends their
pursuits, loves a sylph and detests a gnome. That familiar things
are made new, every paragraph will prove. The subject of the poem
is an event below the common incidents of common life; nothing
real is introduced that is not seen so often as to be no longer
regarded; yet the whole detail of a female day is here brought
before us, invested with so much art of decoration, that, though
nothing is disguised, everything is striking, and we feel all the
appetite of curiosity for that from which we have a thousand times
turned fastidiously away.</p>

<p>The purpose of the poet is, as he tells us, to laugh at "the little
unguarded follies of the female sex." It is therefore without justice
that Dennis charges the Rape of the Lock with the want of a moral,
and for that reason sets it below the Lutrin, which exposes the pride
and discord of the clergy. Perhaps neither Pope nor Boileau has
made the world much better than he found it, but, if they had both
succeeded, it were easy to tell who would have deserved most from
public gratitude. The freaks, and humours, and spleen, and vanity
of women, as they embroil families in discord, and fill houses with
disquiet, do more to obstruct the happiness of life in a year than
the ambition of the clergy in many centuries. It has been well
observed, that the misery of man proceeds not from any single
crush of overwhelming evil, but from small vexations continually
repeated.</p>

<p>It is remarked by Dennis likewise that the machinery is superfluous;
that by all the bustle of preternatural operation the main event
is neither hastened nor retarded. To this charge an efficacious
answer is not easily made. The sylphs cannot be said to help or to
oppose, and it must be allowed to imply some want of art, that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
power has not been sufficiently intermingled with the action. Other
parts may likewise be charged with want of connection; the game at
ombre might be spared; but if the lady had lost her hair while she
was intent upon her cards, it might have been inferred that those
who are too fond of play will be in danger of neglecting more
important interests. These perhaps are faults, but what are such
faults to so much excellence?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>The Rape of the Lock at once placed Pope higher than any modern
writer, and exceeded everything of the kind that had appeared in the
republic of letters. Dr. Johnson truly says that it is the most airy,
the most ingenious, and the most delightful of all Pope's compositions.
Indeed, upon this subject there cannot be two opinions. This poem
is founded, however, upon local manners. And of all poems of that
kind it is undoubtedly far the best, whether we consider the exquisite
tone of raillery, a certain musical sweetness and suitableness in the
versification, the management of the story, or the kind of fancy and
airiness given to the whole. But what entitles it to its high claim of
peculiar poetic excellences?&mdash;the powers of imagination, and the
felicity of invention displayed in adopting, and most artfully conducting,
a machinery so fanciful, so appropriate, so novel, and so
poetical. The introduction of Discord, &amp;c., as machinery in the
Lutrin, &amp;c., is not to be mentioned at the same time. Such a being
as Discord will suit a hundred subjects; but the elegant, the airy
sylph,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Loose to the wind, whose airy garments flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dipped in the richest tincture of the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>such a being as this, is suited alone to the identical and peculiar
poem in which it is employed. I will now go a step farther in
appreciating the elegance and beauty of this poem, and I would ask
the question, Let any other poet,&mdash;Dryden, Waller, Cowley, or
Gray,&mdash;be assigned this subject, and this machinery: could they
have produced a work altogether so correct and beautiful from the
same given materials? Let us, however, still remember, that this
poem is founded on local manners, and the employment of the sylphs
is in artificial life. For this reason the poem must have a secondary
rank, when considered strictly and truly with regard to its poetry.
Whether Pope would have excelled as much in loftier subjects of a
general nature, in the "high mood" of Lycidas, the rich colourings
of Comus, and the magnificent descriptions and sublime images of
Paradise Lost; or in painting the characters and employments of
aerial beings,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
That tread the ooze of the salt deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or run upon the sharp wind of the north,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>

is another question. He has not attempted it: I have no doubt he
would have failed. But to have produced a poem, infinitely the
highest of its kind, and which no other poet could perhaps altogether
have done so well, is surely very high praise. The excellence is
Pope's own, the inferiority is in the subject. No one understood
better that excellent rule of Horace:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Sumite materiam vestris, qui scribitis, æquam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Viribus.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>From the statement of Pope in the edition of 1736, it would be
inferred that the Rape of the Lock in its second form was prepared
and published in 1712. As usual he ante-dated his work. The
original sketch came out in 1712; the machinery was added in 1713,
and the enlarged poem was not published till the spring of 1714.
Warburton's narrative, which in some editions had Pope's initial
affixed by an error of the press,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> is in part derived from Pope, and
the rest is erroneous. The person who bespoke the Rape of the
Lock was not Mr. Secretary Caryll, but his nephew, the Sussex
squire, and for years the correspondent of Pope. The assertion of
Warburton, that Pope, when he wrote the work, was acquainted with
his heroine, is discredited by his letter to Caryll on May 28, 1712.
"Mr. Bedingfield," he there says, "has done me the favour to send
some books of the Rape to my Lord Petre and Mrs. Fermor," and
unless the poet had been a total stranger to them he would have presented
the copies himself. The language of the motto can only bear
the interpretation of Warburton, that the Rape of the Lock "was
written or published at the lady's request," but Warburton ought to
have seen that the motto was a deception. The piece was not
<i>written</i> at Miss Fermor's request, for it was absurd to imagine that
she would ask any one to compose a poem to allay her own resentment
against Lord Petre, and there is the direct statement of Pope
in the body of the work, and in his conversation with Spence, that
the suggestion did not come from her.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The piece was not <i>published</i>
at her request, for in the Dedication of the second edition to Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Fermor, Pope says of the first edition, "An imperfect copy having
been offered to a bookseller, you had the good nature for my sake to
consent to the publication of one more correct. This I was forced
to before I had executed half my design, for the machinery was
entirely wanting to complete it." Warburton reversed the parts.
The requester was Pope, and Miss Fermor gave a consent which it
was vain to refuse when the sole alternative presented to her was
whether the poem should be printed surreptitiously, or under the
supervision of its author. The miserable farce of circulating copies
of a work, and then alleging that the publication had become a
necessary measure of self-defence, was one of those transparent pretences
which deceived no one except the person who fancied that he
was deceiving. Pope never wrote a line of the smallest value which
was not intended for the printer.</p>

<p>The motto from Martial was doubtless attached to the Rape of the
Lock in the belief that Miss Fermor would be proud to countenance
the misrepresentation. The poet was mistaken. "A few years ago,"
says Dr. Johnson, "a niece of Mrs. Fermor, who presided in an
English convent at Paris, mentioned Pope's work with very little
gratitude, rather as an insult than an honour; and she may be
supposed to have inherited the opinion of her family."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Pope told
Spence that "nobody but Sir George Brown was angry," and Warburton
says that Miss Fermor "took the poem so well as to give
about copies of it," but we now know that Johnson was right in his
inference. "Sir Plume blusters, I hear," wrote Pope to the younger
Caryll, Nov. 8, 1712, five months after the Rape of the Lock
appeared; "nay, the celebrated lady herself is offended, and, which
is stranger, not at herself, but me. Is not this enough to make a
writer never be tender of another's character or fame?" Respect for
the fame and feelings of his heroine was not an act of grace; it was
an imperious duty. At the request of a common friend he had
composed a poem for an amiable purpose upon an incident of private
life, and it would have been a hateful abuse of his commission, a
slanderous violation of domestic sanctities, if he had penned a word
which could sully the reputation of an innocent maiden. He is not
free from reproach. Without intending to transgress he offended
from inherent want of delicacy. He made Belinda the subject of
some gross double meanings, which provoked the ribald comments
of the critics, and, unless a morbid love of notoriety had extinguished
feminine purity, she must have been deeply outraged by being associated
with these licentious allusions. Her indignation may appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to have come too late, for though her consent to the publication of
the work, when there was no real choice, does not involve approval,
she might, through her friends, have effectually demanded the
suppression of degrading couplets. Her very resentment, however,
when she read the work in print, is a presumption that they were
not in the manuscript which was sent her, and indeed it is incredible
that she, or her family, could ever have sanctioned such revolting
personalities. They are a sad exhibition of the ingrained coarseness
of Pope's taste,&mdash;of his incapacity to conceive the idea of womanly
homage to outward decency, to say nothing of innate refinement and
modesty.</p>

<p>In the interval between the first and second edition of the Rape
of the Lock, Pope was compelled to acknowledge that he had inflicted
an injury on Miss Fermor. "I have some thoughts," he wrote to
Caryll, Dec. 15, 1713, "of dedicating the poem to her by name, as
a piece of justice in return to the wrong interpretations she has
suffered under on the score of that piece." He tried a preface
"which salved the lady's honour without affixing her name," but she
preferred the dedication. She wished to be dissociated from his
heroine, and he propitiated her by saying, all the incidents are
"fabulous except the loss of your hair; and the character of
Belinda, as it is now managed, resembles you in nothing but beauty."
"I believe," he wrote to Caryll, January 9, 1714, "I have managed
the dedication so nicely that it can neither hurt the lady nor the
author. I writ it very lately, and upon great deliberation. The
young lady approves of it, and the best advice in the kingdom, of
the men of sense, has been made use of in it, even to the treasurer's."
Plainer understandings will be puzzled to discover what scope there
could be for the "great deliberation" of the poet, and the advice of
all the ablest men throughout the kingdom, including the prime
minister, Lord Oxford, in making a simple declaration of a simple
fact. To complete the absolution of Miss Fermor, Pope substituted
another motto for the lines from Martial, and when their temporary
withdrawal had answered his purpose he restored them in the quarto
edition of his works.</p>

<p>A more celebrated feud, if we are to trust the account of Warburton,
took its rise from the Rape of the Lock. The success of the
first edition "encouraged the author to give it a more important air"
by the addition of the supernatural machinery. "Full," says Warburton,
"of this noble conception he communicated it to Mr. Addison,
who he imagined would have been equally delighted with the
improvement. On the contrary, he had the mortification to see
his friend receive it coldly; and even to advise him against any
alteration, for that the poem in its original state was a delicious little
thing, and, as he expressed it, <i>merum sal</i>. Mr. Pope was shocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
for his friend, and then first began to open his eyes to his character."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
The charge has been exposed by Johnson, Macaulay, and
Croker. Mr. Croker denies that the machinery was a plausible suggestion.
"I believe Addison's advice," he says, "to have been a
sincere and just opinion, and such as I should have expected from
the purity of his taste. The original poem tells the actual story
and exhibits a picture of real manners with so much wit and poetry,
but also with so much simplicity and clearness, that I can well
imagine that Addison might be alarmed at the proposition of introducing
sylphs and gnomes into a scene of common life already so
admirably described. Even now, with the advantage of seeing all
the brilliancy with which Pope has worked out what Addison thought
an unfortunate conception, I will not deny that such is the charm
of truth that I have lately read the first sketch with more interest,
though certainly with less admiration than its more fanciful and
more gorgeous successor, which really seems something like a beauty
oppressed with the weight and splendour of her ornaments. The
game at cards, the most ingenious and beautiful of all the additions,
is only reality splendidly embellished, and would have been equally
well placed in the first sketch." Macaulay vindicates the counsel of
Addison upon a general principle, irrespective of the apparent want
of fitness between supernatural agents and the frivolities of fashion,&mdash;a
principle "the result of wide and long experience," which is, that a
successful work of imagination is injured by being recast. "We
cannot at this moment," he says, "call to mind a single instance in
which this rule has been transgressed with happy effect, except the
instance of the Rape of the Lock. Tasso recast his Jerusalem.
Akenside recast his Pleasures of the Imagination, and his Epistle to
Curio. Pope himself, emboldened no doubt by the success with
which he had expanded and remodelled the Rape of the Lock, made
the same experiment on the Dunciad. All these attempts failed.
Who was to foresee that Pope would once in his life be able to do
what he could not himself do twice, and what nobody else has ever
done? Addison's advice was good, but if it had been bad, why
should we pronounce it dishonest? Scott tells us that one of his
best friends predicted the failure of Waverley. Herder adjured
Goethe not to take so unpromising a subject as Faust. Hume tried
to dissuade Robertson from writing the History of Charles the
Fifth. Nay Pope himself was one of those who prophesied that
Cato would never succeed on the stage, and advised Addison to
print it without risking a representation.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> But Scott, Goethe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Robertson, Addison, had the good sense and generosity to give their
advisers credit for the best intentions. Pope's heart was not of the
same kind with theirs."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Of the examples, which Macaulay quotes,
of poems marred in the attempt to mend them, the Jerusalem of
Tasso was the only one which existed in the days of Addison; and
the Jerusalem was not a parallel case, for the mind of Tasso was
diseased when he remodelled his work, and he yielded, against his
judgment, to the cavils of critics instead of obeying the self-born
calls of imagination. Most men nevertheless would instinctively
recommend that whatever was beautiful should be let alone, lest it
should be deteriorated in the effort to make it better. When Pope
boasted that the adaptation of the new parts to the old, in the Rape
of the Lock, was the greatest triumph of his skill, he himself confessed
the risk and difficulty of the process, and justified the misgivings
of Addison. But besides the general hazard, we should
expect, with Mr. Croker, that Addison would have thought the
particular project for improving the poem to be essentially bad.
Pope had shown a predilection for heathen mythology, and his
management of it had been clumsy and lifeless. His scheme
would have called up to Addison's mind the interposition of the
gods and goddesses in Homer and Virgil. The conjunction of
these obsolete figments, under new names, with the trivialities
of modern society, would have seemed incongruous and pedantic,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
and the previous works of Pope would have compelled the conclusion
that he had not the skill to deal with ethereal fiction. Addison
could neither have divined from a conversational description how
perfectly the agents would be adapted to their office, nor from
Pope's existing poetry how delicious they would be rendered by the
felicity of the execution. Unless there was the strongest presumption
that the recommendation to leave the poem unaltered was made
in good faith, we should not be warranted in believing the story,
for no reliance could be placed on the unsupported testimony of Pope
when he was safe from contradiction, and his object was to damage
the reputation of a rival.</p>

<p>Pope is convicted on his own evidence. He admits that the incident
"<i>first</i> opened his eyes to the character of Addison," and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
consequence that Addison's conduct had been hitherto blameless.
He thus bears witness against himself of his readiness to impute the
basest motives upon the most trumpery pretexts. Being "<i>shocked</i>"
at the moral turpitude of "his friend," he could never again have
treated him with cordiality and confidence, and the alienation which
ensued, must, on Pope's own showing, have had its origin in Pope's
morbid suspicions. But there was an earlier transaction, which turns
the tables with fatal force upon Pope. Anterior to the conversation
on the Rape of the Lock,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> he urged Lintot the bookseller to persuade
Dennis to criticise Addison's Cato.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Dennis published his Remarks,
and Pope followed with his anonymous pamphlet, Dr. Norris's Narrative
of the Phrenzy of J.D.,&mdash;a coarse, dull production, consisting of nothing
but low, intemperate abuse. Pope's device pointed to three results.
He would damage the reputation of Addison's play; he would provoke
him into turning his wrath upon Dennis; and he would secure an
opening for venting his own spleen against the critic without seeming
to be actuated by personal spite. Addison was disgusted with the
pamphlet; and, ignorant probably of its parentage, he let Dennis
know that he repudiated and condemned it.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The worst was to come.
More than twenty years afterwards Pope dressed up a letter which he
had written to Caryll, on the occasion of an attack in the Flying
Post, and pretended that it had been written to Addison when his
play was assailed by Dennis. In this fraudulent document Pope
congratulates him on his share in "the envy and calumny, which
is the portion of all good and great men," and declares that "he
felt more warmth" at the Remarks on Cato than when he read the
Reflections on the Essay on Criticism.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Having prompted the abuse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
he published a fictitious letter to persuade the world that he had
overflowed with generous indignation. He wanted posterity to believe
that he had poured out these magnanimous sentiments to
Addison, who returned him envy and malice. His object was to
magnify his own virtues, and transfer his meanness and jealousy to
the amiable genius he had formerly wronged. "Addison," he said,
"was very kind to me at first, but my bitter enemy afterwards,"<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
and with the consciousness of guilt, he tried to conceal that he had
forfeited the kindness by misconduct. He was bold with his forgeries
and falsehoods in the confidence that a dead man could tell no tales.
Happily there are flaws in the best-laid dishonest plots, and the hour
of retribution comes at last. At what period or in what degree
Addison himself detected Pope's practices is not definitely known,
but he discovered enough to avoid him. "Leave him as soon as you
can," he said to Lady Mary W. Montagu;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a name="He_has_an_appetite" id="He_has_an_appetite">
"he will certainly play
you some devilish trick else. He has an appetite to satire."</a></p>

<p>Up to the Rape of the Lock, Pope had only put borrowed thoughts
into verse. He now broke out into originality, but not without some
obligation to his predecessors. In one place De Quincey maintains
that the Rape of the Lock was not suggested by the Lutrin, because
Pope did not read French with ease to himself, and in another place
that Voltaire must have been wrong in saying that "Pope could
hardly read French," inasmuch as there are "numerous proofs that
he had read Boileau with so much feeling of his peculiar merit that
he has appropriated and naturalised some of his best passages."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
The second statement of De Quincey was the latest and the truest.
Pope refers to the Lutrin in his manuscript notes on the Remarks of
Dennis, and certainly had it in his mind when he framed the scheme
of his poem. "The treasurer," it is said, in the summary prefixed
to Boileau's work, "is the highest dignitary in the chapter. The
precentor is the second dignitary. In front of the seat of the latter
there was formerly an enormous reading-desk, which almost concealed
him. He had it removed, and the treasurer wanted to put it back.
Hence arose the dispute which is the subject of the present poem."
Boileau converted the squabble into a satire on the indolence, the
sensuality, and pride of the cathedral clergy in the licentious reign of
Louis XIV. Pope converted the quarrel between Miss Fermor and
Lord Petre into a satire on the frivolities of a young lady of fashion
from her morning toilet to the close of her giddy day. Boileau called
the Lutrin a new species of burlesque, "because," he said, "in other
burlesques Dido and Æneas speak like fishwomen and scavengers;
here a barber and his wife speak like Dido and Æneas." Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
adopted a similar vein, and invested the trifles of a gay and frivolous
life with an adventitious importance. Boileau parodied some well-known
passages of Virgil. Pope parodied both Virgil and Homer.
The Lutrin opens with Discord appearing to the sleeping treasurer,
and warning him against the encroachments of the rebellious precentor.
The enlarged Rape of the Lock opens with Ariel appearing, in
a dream, to Belinda, and beseeching her to beware of some disastrous
impending event. The raillery on the foibles of women, which is the
central idea in Pope's poem, was caught up from the exquisite
pleasantry of Addison, who, in the Tatlers and Spectators, had endeavoured
to laugh the fair sex out of their levities of behaviour, and
extravagances of dress. Through his delicate humour, it had become
the popular topic in the light literature of the day.</p>

<p>Johnson says of the sylphs that they are "a new race of beings,"
and that there is nothing "but the names of his agents which Pope has
not invented." This is an exaggeration. The names were a considerable
part of the novelty; for, in the fundamental conception, the
sylphs in the Rape of the Lock were the time-honoured fairies of
English literature. Their immediate prototypes are the elves of
Shakespeare. The sprites of Pope belong to the same family with
the diminutive, joyous, ethereal creatures which anciently crept into
acorn cups, couched in the bells of cowslips, or lived under blossoms;
who sported in air, rode on the curled clouds, and flitted with the
swiftness of thought over land and sea; who hung dew-drops on
flowers, fetched jewels from the deep, shaded sleeping eyes from
moonbeams with wings plucked from painted butterflies, and who
mingled, benignly or maliciously, in all but the graver varieties of
human affairs. Pope acknowledges the ancestry of his newly-named
race when Ariel,&mdash;whose own name confesses his parentage,&mdash;addressing
his subjects, says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ye sylphs and sylphids, to your chief give ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fays, fairies, genii, elves, and demons hear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The benevolent and mischievous fairies of old days were, in their
turn, little more than the good and evil angels dwarfed to suit their
lighter functions. For the precise outward aspect which Pope assigned
to the sylphs, he was beholden to Spenser, with whose works he was
well acquainted:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
And all about her neck and shoulders flew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A flock of little loves, and sports, and joys,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With nimble wings of gold and purple hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><a name="Whose_shapes_seemed_not" id="Whose_shapes_seemed_not">
Whose shapes seemed not like to terrestrial boys,</a></span><br />
<span class="i2">But like to angels playing heav'nly toys.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These are just the beings who hover round Belinda. But though
Johnson's claim for Pope is over-stated, his supernatural agents are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the product of genius. The vividness with which they are described,
the novel offices they fulfil, the poetic beauty with which they are
invested, even when engaged in employments not in their nature
poetic, constitute them a distinct variety, and they rise up before
our minds like a fresh creation, and not as the reflection of antecedent
familiar forms. The remark is true of the work throughout.
What Pope borrowed he varied, embellished, and combined in
a manner which leaves the poem unique. Some of the parts may be
traced to earlier sources, but few master-pieces have more originality
in the aggregate.</p>

<p>"The Rape of the Lock," says De Quincey, "is the most exquisite
monument of playful fancy that universal literature offers."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> "The
Rape of the Lock," says Hazlitt, "is the most exquisite specimen of
filigree work ever invented. It is made of gauze and silver spangles.
The most glittering appearance is given to everything&mdash;to paste,
pomatum, billets-doux, and patches. Airs, languid airs, breathe
around; the atmosphere is perfumed with affectation. A toilet is
described with the solemnity of an altar raised to the goddess of
vanity, and the history of a silver bodkin is given with all the pomp
of heraldry. No pains are spared, no profusion of ornament, no
splendour of poetic diction to set off the meanest things. The balance
between the concealed irony and the assumed gravity is as nicely
trimmed as the balance of power in Europe. The little is made great
and the great little. You hardly know whether to laugh or weep.
It is the triumph of insignificance, the apotheosis of foppery and
folly. It is the perfection of the mock-heroic."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The world of
fashion is displayed in its most gorgeous and attractive hues, and
everywhere the emptiness is visible beneath the outward splendour.
The beauty of Belinda, the details of her toilet, her troops of admirers,
her progress up the Thames, the game at cards, the aerial escort which
attend upon her, are all set forth with unrivalled grace and fascination,
and all bear the impress of vanity and vexation. Nothing can
exceed the art with which the satire is blended with the pomp,
mocking without disturbing the unsubstantial gewgaw. The double
vein is kept up with sustained skill in the picture of the outward
charms and inward frivolity of women. Ariel, describing the influence
of the sylphs upon them, says, that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
With varying vanities from ev'ry part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shift the moving toy-shop of their heart.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is the tone throughout. Their hearts are toy-shops. They
reverse the relative importance of things, and, as Hazlitt says, the
"little" with them "is great, and the great little." The Bible is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
mixed up with "files of pins, puffs, powders, patches, billets-doux."
Chastity and china, prayers and masquerades, love and jewellery are
put upon a nominal equality, but with a manifest preponderance in
favour of the china, masquerades, and jewellery. The female passion
is for carriages, dress, cards, rank, and it is an insoluble mystery that
"a belle should reject a lord." The "grave Clarissa," who rebukes
the "airs and flights" of Belinda, can offer no higher motive for
intermixing solid with trifling qualities than</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
That <i>men</i> may say, when we the front-box grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Behold the first in virtue as in face!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The continuous raillery against female foibles is playful in its poignancy.
The whole wears a festive air, and has none of the ill-nature and
venom which marked Pope's later satire.</p>

<p>In allotting their several functions to the sylphs, Ariel reserves
Belinda's lap-dog for his own especial charge:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dennis said it was "contrary to all manner of judgment and decorum"
that the chief of the aerial train should be "only the keeper of a vile
Iceland cur," instead of protecting "the lady's favourite lock."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
Ruffhead repeated the futile objection.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> "Black omens" announced
that some misfortune would befall Belinda, but the precise calamity
had been "wrapped by the fates in night." For aught Ariel knew,
the attack might be directed against the favourite dog, which is
neither "vile" nor "a cur" in Pope's poem, and which we may do
Belinda the justice to believe was more precious in her eyes than even
a favourite ringlet. She would rather have sacrificed her lock than
her dog. Dennis from hostility, and Ruffhead from dullness, missed
the meaning of the stroke. The climax of the omens which prefigured
the coming disaster was that "Poll sat mute, and Shock was most
unkind." The "shrieks" of the heroine, when the catastrophe
arrived, were such as "when husbands or when lap-dogs breathe their
last." A gnome bent upon mischief made pampered lap-dogs ill, and
bright eyes wept over them. The undue fondness for dogs and
parrots, to the depreciation of the higher claims of humanity, was no
uncommon failing, and Pope's design was to ridicule it. Locks of
hair did not usurp the same supreme dominion, and Ariel, ignorant
where the danger would light, is properly represented as guarding the
pet dog, which had the first place in the affections of heartless women
of fashion.</p>

<p>To the distempered mind of Dennis the sylphs appeared an absurd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
excrescence. "They neither promote," he says, "nor retard the
danger of Belinda."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Johnson admits the force of the observation,
and thinks it "implies some want of art that their power has not been
sufficiently intermingled with the action." The criticism seems hasty.
The sylphs have a large share in the fascination of Belinda. Their
province is to heighten and protect her charms,&mdash;to preside at her
toilet, to imprison essences, to save the powder from too rude a gale,
to steal washes from the rainbow, to assist her blushes, and inspire
her airs. They perform these offices up to the fatal moment, and are
not an incumbrance to the narrative merely because they cannot avert
the final stroke. Nay, their impotence to stay the crisis is in keeping
with the general spirit of the poem. Belinda leads a life of vanity,
and the sylphs are the ministers of vanity. They are lustrous with
a butterfly beauty, the patrons of ephemeral folly, and it would be
inconsistent with the moral if they could have ensured a perpetual
triumph to weaknesses which inevitably terminate in mortification.
Pope accounts for the failure of the watchful legion to turn aside the
catastrophe. Ariel recognises that his power is gone when he perceives
"an earthly lover lurking at Belinda's heart,"&mdash;an intimation, perhaps,
that lovers are headstrong and incapable of guidance. Johnson asserts,
and with as little reason, that the game of cards, like the machinery,
has no connection with the subject of the poem. That subject is the
exaltation of a beautiful young lady throughout a day of glittering
fashion, till the hollow pomp ends in humiliation, anger, and tears.
Whatever amusements and pageantry entered into a day of the kind
belonged directly to the theme, provided they could be made subservient
to poetic effect.</p>

<p>When Ariel, baffled and weeping, is compelled to resign his charge,
the gnomes rush upon the scene, and retain their ascendancy till near
the end. They are but slightly sketched, and all we hear of the
appearance they present is that they have "a dusky, melancholy"
aspect, and "sooty pinions." Their functions are the opposite to
those of the sylphs,&mdash;they give lap-dogs diseases, discompose head-dresses,
raise pimples on beauteous faces, engender pride, and spoil
graces. Dennis detected a flaw. Umbriel descends to the Cave of
Spleen, and procures from the goddess a bag filled with the impetuous,
and a phial with the depressing passions. The gnome empties the
bag of "sighs, sobs, and the war of tongues" on Belinda, who immediately
"burns with more than mortal ire." The gnome next
breaks over her the phial of "fainting fears and soft sorrows," when
she exchanges her expression of rage for "eyes half-languishing, half-drowned
in tears." "Now," says Dennis, "what could be more
useless, whether we look upon the bag or the bottle?"<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Without any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
assistance from the contents of the bag the "livid lightning had
flashed from Belinda's eyes," and she had "rent the affrighted skies
with her screams of horror." Without any assistance from the bottle
she was found, on the gnome's return, sunk in the arms of a friend,
"her hair unbound, and her eyes dejected." Pope replied on the
margin of his copy of Dennis's pamphlet, that Juno in the Æneid
summons Alecto from the infernal regions to stir up Amata, who was
already burning with anger. This was no answer if the cases had
been parallel, which they were not, for Amata's anger was only a
passive irritation, and Alecto was sent to goad her into active fury.
A few words would have obviated the criticism of Dennis, but the
Cave of Spleen would still be out of place. The personifications of
ill-nature, affectation, and diseased fancies are literal descriptions of
men and women transferred from the surface of the globe to a pretended
world at its centre. Where no invention is displayed, where
there is nothing to gratify and beguile the imagination, the departure
from fact is distasteful to the mind. Instead of copying classic fables,
unsuited to modern times, Pope might have exhibited the inhabitants
of his Cave of Spleen in the midst of that society to which they belonged,
and ascribed their repulsive qualities to the instigation of the
gnomes. These rather nugatory beings would have gained in importance,
and the pictures of the peevish, the affected, and the splenetic
would have gained in force and truth.</p>

<p>Dennis justly found fault with particular passages, which are equally
false to social usages, and the general conception of the poem. The
exultation of Belinda at winning a game of cards takes the form of
"shouts which fill the sky," and which are echoed back from "the
woods and long canals." The impertinence of the baron in cutting off
her curl required a strong expression of indignation, but not that "the
affrighted skies should be rent with screams of horror." At the conclusion
of the battle, which in some of its incidents is a mere vulgar
brawl, Belinda again manifests her stentorian propensities by "roaring
in a louder strain than fierce Othello." There is no affinity between
Belinda gentle, graceful, and captivating, and Belinda shouting,
screaming, and roaring. Pope called his poem "heroi-comical," and
it is evident that he attached different meanings to the word. It
was "heroi-comical" to bring supernatural machinery to bear upon
common-place life, and surround the toilet and card-table with a fairy
brilliancy. It was equally "heroi-comical" to give vent to the ebullitions
of tragic or jovial frenzy on trivial occasions. The first
species of the "heroi-comical" lent a borrowed splendour to its
objects; the second species was burlesque, and reduced the heroine
in her angry moods, to the level of a coarse, plebeian termagant, and
in her joyous moments to that of an unmannerly, low-bred romp.
The two species of the "heroi-comical" could not be applied to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
same person without jarring discordance, and fortunately the burlesque
and disenchanting element is only sparingly introduced.</p>

<p>"The Rape of the Lock," said Dennis, "is an empty trifle, which
cannot have a moral." The Lutrin, he maintains, on the contrary,
is "an important satirical poem upon the luxury, pride, and animosities
of the <i>popish clergy</i>, and the moral is, that when christians, and
especially the <i>clergy</i>, run into great heats about <i>religious</i> trifles, their
animosity proceeds from the want of that <i>religion</i> which is the pretence
of their quarrel."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Pope erased the epithet "religious," and
substituting "female sex" for "popish clergy," "ladies" for "clergy,"
and "sense" for "religion," claimed the description for the Rape of
the Lock. Dennis quotes some lines in which Boileau, he says, gives
"broad hints of his real meaning," and Pope writes on the margin
the words, "Clarissa's speech,"&mdash;a speech which is more definite than
any of the hints in the Lutrin. In delicious verse Clarissa dwells on
the transitory power of a handsome face, insists on the superior influence
of good humour, and concludes with the couplet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charms strike the sight,
but merit wins the soul.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The moral here summed up pervades the poem, which is a continuous
satire on a tinsel existence. The injunction to be sweet-tempered is
indignantly rejected by Belinda, for the piece was professedly founded
on a subsisting feud, but the common sense of the admonitions
shames the folly which rejects them. Dennis undertook an impossible
task when he laboured to demonstrate the superiority of Boileau.
The Lutrin is stilted, extravagant, and prosaic by the side of the
Rape of the Lock.</p>

<p>Dennis's pamphlet against the Rape of the Lock consisted of
seven letters and a preface. Of four of these letters, Pope has
written, in his copy, sarcastic summaries, which throw no light
on his poem, but which betray by their exaggeration, his soreness
at the criticisms. Letter 1. "Proving that Boileau did not call
his Lutrin, Poeme Héroi-Comique, that Bossu does not say [anything
of] the machines, and that Butler [wrote]<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> the notes to his own
Hudibras." Letter 2. "Mr. Dennis's positive word that the Rape
of the Lock <i>can</i> be nothing but a trifle, and that the Lutrin cannot
be so, however it may appear." Letter 3. "Where it appears to
demonstration that no handsome lady ought to dress herself, and no
modest one to cry out or be angry." Letter 5. "Showeth that the
Rosicrucian doctrine is not the christian, and that Callimachus and
Catullus were a couple of fools." Catullus and Callimachus are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
not mentioned by Dennis. He had only condemned a passage
in Pope which was imitated from these poets. In the third letter
Dennis said nothing against handsome women dressing themselves,
or against modest women crying out, but maintained that simplicity
of dress was more becoming than lavish adornments, and that
"well-bred ladies," when joyful or angry, did not fill the skies and
surrounding country with their shoutings and roarings. In the first
letter the note of some commentator on Hudibras was ascribed by
Dennis to Butler, and in the second letter he asserted that Boileau
showed more judgment in styling the Lutrin an "heroic poem" than
did Pope in terming the Rape of the Lock "heroi-comical." Dennis
was not aware that Boileau in 1709 had replaced "héroique" by
"héroi-comique," and that the English poet borrowed the epithet
from his French precursor. Pope's manuscript annotations are not
behind Dennis's text in petty cavils. The combatants were both too
angry to be candid; or if Dennis shows candour, it is in his undisguised
disregard of it. He fulminated against Pope for calling the
objects of his dislike "fool, dunce, blockhead, scoundrel." "Nothing,"
he continues, "incapacitates a man so much for using foul
language as good sense, good-nature, and good-breeding; and nothing
qualifies a man more for it than his being a clown, a fool, and a
barbarian." Therefore, said he, "I shall call A. P&mdash;&mdash;E neither fool
nor dunce, nor blockhead; but I shall prove that he is all these in
a most egregious manner."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> For boasting a virtue in the act of
violating it Dennis had no competitor.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, writing to Mr. Dyce says, "Pope, in that production
of his boyhood, the Ode to Solitude, and in his Essay on Criticism,
has furnished proofs that at one period of his life he felt the charm
of a sober and subdued style, which he afterwards abandoned for one
that is, to my taste at least, too pointed and ambitious, and for a
versification too timidly balanced."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Southey and Coleridge accused
Pope of debasing the public taste, but they agreed in laying the
blame on his "meretricious" Homer, and excepted from their condemnation
works which Wordsworth included in his censure. "The
mischief," says Southey, "was effected not by Pope's satirical and
moral pieces, for these entitle him to the highest place among poets
of his class; it was by his Homer. No other work in the language
so greatly vitiated the diction of English poetry."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> "In the course
of one of my lectures," says Coleridge, "I had occasion to point out
the almost faultless position and choice of words in Pope's original
compositions, particularly in his Satires, and Moral Essays, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
purpose of comparing them with his translation of Homer, which I do
not stand alone in regarding as the main source of our pseudo-poetic
diction."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Wordsworth loved simplicity of composition, and language
not ornate. His preference for the Essay on Criticism would
be intelligible if the piece had been free from adorned passages, and
the strained attempt to be pointed in some of the similes; or if the
style, in the quieter passages, had been consummate of its kind.
Cowper has described the qualities which are essential to the highest
excellence in this species of poetry. "Every man," he says, "conversant
with verse-making, knows by painful experience that the
familiar style is of all styles the most difficult to succeed in. To
make verse speak the language of prose, without being prosaic, to
marshal the words of it in such an order as they might naturally
take in falling from the lips of an extemporary speaker, yet without
meanness, harmoniously, elegantly, and without seeming to displace
a syllable for the sake of rhyme, is one of the most arduous tasks a
poet can undertake."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Pope, in his Essay on Criticism, did not
reach Cowper's standard, and far happier specimens of the style will
be found in some of his Satires.</p>

<p>The Rape of the Lock greatly surpasses in execution the Essay on
Criticism; and austere, indeed, must be the taste which could condemn
it. The "position of the words" is not always "faultless,"
for Pope admitted too many of his usual inversions, but the phraseology
is beautiful in itself, and exquisitely adapted to the subject. The
language, simple in its units, is rich in combination, without ever
being florid or profuse. The poet had to depict empty glories made
up of outward pageantry, and as rainbows cannot be painted with
grey, so Pope dipped his pen in the glowing colours which represented
the things. He could not have employed his radiant tints with
greater delicacy and power. Few as are the details, the scenic effect
is complete. He displayed his judgment in eschewing minuteness
which would have been tedious and prosaic; the frail, superficial
show could only be imposing in a general view. The pointed lines
which offended Wordsworth, are not more numerous than befit the
theme. A certain sparkle of style accorded best with the glitter of
the world described. Dennis denounced the "puns." He said,
"they shocked the rules of true pleasantry, and bore the same proportion
to thought which bubbles held to bodies."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Two or three
of the double-meanings are offensive from that grossness which is the
single serious flaw in the brilliant gem. The few which remain are
legitimate in a lively poem, when thus sparingly introduced. Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
are they common puns, but words used at once in their literal and
metaphorical sense:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Or stain her honour or her new brocade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lose her heart or necklace at a ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He first the snuff-box opened then the case.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Johnson has pointed out that Denham's verses on the Thames, "O!
could I flow like thee," are marked by the same property, and no
one would call them punning lines.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>The enlarged edition of the Rape of the Lock had a rapid popularity.
"It has in four days' time," wrote Pope to Caryll, March 12,
1714, "sold to the number of three thousand, and is already reprinted."
"The sylphs and the gnomes," says Tyers, "were the
deities of the day."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Much of the relish, with the herd of readers,
has passed away with the novelty. "Of the Rape of the Lock," says
Professor Reed, "I acknowledge my inability of admiration,"<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and
numbers who admire would qualify the superlative language of
De Quincey, Hazlitt, and Bowles. The conventional elegancies of a
particular class do not appeal to universal sympathy. Many persons
can enter no better into the fanciful beauty which is thrown around
routine trivialities. The facts with them are too strong to admit of
fiction. To these inaptitudes it must be added that the subtle
delicacies of humour, satire, language, and invention, which mingle
largely with the obvious beauties of the Rape of the Lock, can only
be perceived when the taste has been quickened by the early culture
of letters. De Quincey remarks that, with all orders of men, the
elementary passions and principles are easiest understood, for the
seeds of them are sown in every mind, and Milton and Shakespeare
speak to understandings which are impervious to the refined and airy
graces of Pope's artificial world.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>A few have gone into the opposite extreme, and placed Pope on a
level with Shakespeare and Milton themselves. His strongest claim
to the distinction is the Rape of the Lock, but wide is the interval,
whether the test is character, passions, manners, descriptions, or
machinery. The characters in Pope's poem are slight and superficial.
There is a miniature sketch of an empty-headed fop, and an
outside view of a beautiful young lady fond of dress, amusements,
and admiration; the rest of the human personages are shadows.
Passions, says Bowles, are the soul of poetry, and in poetry of the
highest order they are grand, terrible, pathetic, or lovely; the grovelling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
ludicrous, and trivial passions are of a less poetical species.
The passions of Belinda belong to this lower class. Her grief and
anger at the loss of her curl are professedly mock-heroic. They are
disproportioned to the frivolous cause, and neither kindle, nor are
meant to kindle, sympathy. The manners are not the index to
inner depths,&mdash;the outward expression of the noble, the awful, or the
tender. They are an exterior varnish, the mere formalities of
fashion. The descriptions, apart from the sylphs, are chiefly of the
toilet, the card-table, and such-like things, which have no kin-ship
with the strong, abiding emotions. The very sylphs, by their employments,
are, poetically, of an inferior race to the fairies who met</p>

<p>The beings who luxuriate in the everlasting beauties of nature have
a deeper charm for us than creatures whose chief delight is in the
little artifices of a woman's toilet. The skill is exquisite by which the
ephemeral nothings of gay fashion are coloured with the hues of poetic
fancy, but in spite of the brilliancy they remain nothings still, and
cannot compete with strains which are struck from the profoundest
chords in the heart and mind of man. Lord Byron, to save the
supremacy of Pope, asserted that "the poet is always ranked according
to his execution."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Bowles maintained that the test of poetical
excellence was the subject and execution combined.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> He admitted
that the loftiest theme in feeble hands would be eclipsed by insignificant
topics when treated by a master, but he said that no genius
could render subordinate topics equal in poetry to the highest
where the execution, as in Shakespeare and Milton, was worthy of
the subject. Lord Byron stultified himself. He had no sooner completed
his proof that execution was the sole criterion of poetry, than
he went on to argue that "the highest of all poetry is ethical poetry,
as the highest of all earthly objects must be moral truth."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> His
paradox did not deserve a reply, even if he had not contradicted it
the moment it was uttered. Hume wisely recommended that words
should not be wasted upon theories which it is inconceivable that any
human being could believe.</p>

<p>In his Observations on the Poetry of Pope, Bowles put the modes
and incidents of artificial life, the secondary passions, and descriptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of outward objects in a lower grade than the development of
the impressive passions.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> What he said of manners and passions
was suppressed by Campbell, who based his reply upon his own misstatements,
and proceeded to protest against "trying Pope exclusively
by his powers of describing inanimate phenomena."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> No one could
be more emphatic than Bowles in placing souls before things. Of
"inanimate phenomena," he had said that "all images drawn from
what is beautiful or sublime in the works of nature, are more
beautiful and sublime than any images drawn from art." Again, his
antagonists misrepresented him, and arguing as though he had
asserted that all images drawn from nature were beautiful, and that
there was no beauty in any image drawn from art, they imagined
they refuted him by adducing natural objects which were unsightly,
and artificial objects which were the reverse. The canal at Venice,
without the buildings and gondolas "would be nothing," said Lord
Byron, "but a clay-coloured ditch."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The illustration did not touch
the position of Bowles, who had never pretended that the ugly in
nature eclipsed the beautiful in art. His principle was that, beauty
for beauty, Solomon in the richest products of the loom was not
arrayed like the flowers of the field. Campbell did not reason better
than Byron. He selected the launching of a ship of the line for an
instance of the sublime. Admitting, what nobody could deny, that
his ship was poetical, it did not follow that the wooden structure had
the grandeur of the ocean. His language was a virtual confession
that it was inferior. He endowed his "vast bulwark" with attributes
borrowed from nature, human and inanimate. He thought
"of the stormy element on which the vessel was soon to ride, of the
days of battle and nights of danger she had to encounter, of the ends
of the earth which she had to visit, of all that she had to do and
suffer for her country." He found the sublimity, not in the ship,
but in the associations,&mdash;in the stormy waves of the mighty deep
which was to be her home; in the terrors of darkness when she was
tempest-driven; in the vast distances she had to traverse; in the
perils and patriotism of the crew; in the fierce heroic contention of
the battle. Campbell was self-refuted. He fell into the same error
with respect to some fragments he quoted from the poets. Images
derived from nature and art were mixed together, and he did not
perceive that the passages owed their principal beauty to the nature.
The fallacies of disputants who wrote without thinking were easily
exposed, and Bowles got a signal victory over the whole of his
numerous opponents.</p>

<p>Many a work of man, like the ship, impresses us less by its intrinsic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
qualities than by the train of ideas it suggests. Until the errors of
controversialists called for fuller explanations Bowles did not draw
the distinction, and Lord Byron was misled by overlooking it. "The
Parthenon," he said, "is more poetical than the rock on which it
stands."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> "Not," replied Hazlitt, "because it is a work of art,
but because it is a work of art o'erthrown."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Prostrate and broken
columns, rent walls, and mouldering stone, exercise a more potent
sway over the feelings than temples in the freshness of their artistic
beauty. Hazlitt tells the obvious cause. Relics of departed glory,
dilapidated monuments of intellectual splendour, are mementos of
the fate which awaits the proudest works of man. With the
thoughts of mighty reverses mingle the reflections which are always
engendered by antiquity. The imagination reverts to shadowy,
remote generations, to a people and power long ago laid in dust, and
the ruins have a pathos which is the result of the centuries that have
swept over them,&mdash;of the mysteries, vicissitudes, and havoc of time.
When Lord Byron asked if there was an image in Gray's Elegy more
striking than his "shapeless sculptures," his own question might
have revealed the truth to him.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Whatever poetry may be embodied
in the matchless art of Greece, there can be none in the "shapeless
sculptures" of country tomb-stones; but they are memorials set up
by poor cottagers to protect the bones of kindred from insult, and
the whole force of the phrase in the Elegy arises from the prominence
given to the tenderness and affection of which "the shapeless
sculptures" are the symbols. The emotion is extrinsic to the
rude, prosaic, and often ludicrous art. The same image becomes
poetical or unpoetical according to the associations with which it is
linked. The rusting, disused needles of Cowper's Mary, stricken by
paralysis, are associated, Byron says, "with the darning of stockings,
the hemming of shirts, and the mending of breeches."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> This is the
ordinary, mechanic association, and had it been the association called
up by Cowper's lines they would not have been, what Byron pronounced
them, "eminently poetical and pathetic." The associations
are of another kind. The thousands who have shed tears over the
lines to Mary did not pay a tribute to the needles, or the uses to
which the needles were applied. They were melted by the representation&mdash;true
and strong as the living facts&mdash;of love, of decay, of
desolation, and of anguish. The different aspect of the same incident
through the influence of association is exemplified in the
description of the tea in the Rape of the Lock, and in the Task.
The passage of Pope is not united to any sentiment, and only pleases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
from the elegance of the verse and language. Cowper sets the heart
in a glow with the delicious picture he presents of "fire-side enjoyments,
and home-born happiness."</p>

<p>Out-door nature, and the imposing or beautiful passions, were not
"the haunt and main region of Pope's song," and Bowles, after
saying that the representation of nature demanded a susceptible
heart, and an observing eye, goes on to state that "the weak eyes
and tottering strength" of Pope were the reason that he seldom excelled
in depicting natural appearances. His legs would not serve
him to walk nor his eyes to see, and he was limited to the particulars
which "could be gained by books, or suggested by imagination."
"From his infirmities," Bowles continues, "he must have been
chiefly conversant with artificial life, but if he had been gifted with
the same powers of observing outward nature, I have no doubt he
would have evinced as much accuracy in describing the appropriate
and peculiar beauties such as nature exhibits in the Forest where he
lived, as he was able to describe in a manner so novel, and with
colours so vivid, a game of cards."<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The premises are erroneous.
Pope's vision was not bad; his eyes, says Warburton, were "fine,
sharp, and piercing;"<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and though he was too feeble for long walks,
he could, and did, ramble through woods and meadows, and along the
banks of streams. Nine-tenths of the finest descriptions from nature
in the poets are of sights and sounds which were within the range of
his common experience. The decision of Bowles must be reversed,
and we must ascribe the little nature in Pope's works to his want of
mental "susceptibility," and not to physical infirmity. His love of
the country was the cursory admiration which is seldom wanting. He
had none of the exceptional enthusiasm which could lead him to revel
in nature, to scrutinise it, and enrich his mind with its memories. His
strongest sympathies and antipathies were directed to the society of
his day,&mdash;to the men who praised or abused, caressed or defied him.</p>

<p>The object of Bowles in setting forth his critical principles, was
not to condemn descriptions of artificial life or images taken from
art, but to single out the circumstances which render one class of
poetry more exalted than another. The bulk of Pope's works were
satirical and didactic: and the affinity to the highest species of
poetry in the Rape of the Lock, and the Epistle of Eloisa, was not so
complete as to place him on a level with the mightiest masters.
Warton and Bowles united in ranking him before Dryden and next
to Milton.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Johnson doubtfully, and Cowper unhesitatingly, put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Dryden before him.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Cowper states that he had "known persons of
taste and discernment who would not allow that Pope was a poet at
all," and the language of some writers implies that his claim to be
called a poet was a serious moot-point with critics. Johnson gravely
replied to the question "whether Pope was a poet," and Hazlitt said
in 1818, that it was "a question which had hardly yet been
settled."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Who the sceptics were does not appear, and it is probable
that the opinion was never maintained by a single person of
reputation. Pope was placed higher by Warton and Bowles, who
were accused of depreciating, than by Johnson who defended him.
Southey, Wordsworth, and Coleridge had "an antipathy to him,"
according to Byron;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> but this was a false charge, originating in his
own antipathy to Southey, Wordsworth, and Coleridge. They all
admitted that Pope had a brilliant poetical genius, and that many of
his poems were of extraordinary excellence. Wordsworth, the one
perhaps of the three who held him the cheapest, said he was "a
man most highly gifted, who unluckily took to the plain when the
heights were within his reach." Yet, while thinking that his poetry
was not of the most poetical kind "he committed much of him to
memory," acknowledged that "he succeeded as far as he went,"
and in mentioning the persons, dramatists omitted, who were the
representatives of the "poetic genius of England," he specially
named "Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, Dryden, and Pope."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The real
Pope controversy was with the zealots who maintained that he was
of the same flight with Shakespeare and Milton. Their lofty estimate
of his comparative excellence, did not arise from their keener
appreciation of his merits; they were simply men of cold, unimaginative
minds, who were insensible to merits which were greater still.</p>

<p>"Pope," said Hazlitt, "had none of the enthusiasm of poetry;
he was in poetry what the sceptic is in religion."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> This was a
creed he sometimes avowed. "Poetry and criticism," he said in
the preface to his works, "are only the affair of idle men who write
in their closets, and of idle men who read there."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> He talked later
of his "idle songs," but in the same breath, with characteristic
inconsistency, he set up to be the moral reformer of his age, and had
undertaken a little before "to vindicate" in verse "the ways of
God to man."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> His views of his art are contradictory and irreconcileable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
His disparagement of it was an affectation founded upon a
common definition of poetry, that its end was to please. The
premise, false from its incompleteness, led to degrading conclusions.
Hurd, who studied poetry for the purpose of analysing its ingredients,
and who should have known its true properties, adopted the
usual pleasure theory, and at thirty-seven he was naturally ashamed
of his frivolous pursuit. "He must not," he said, "pass more of
his life in these flowery regions; the light food was not the proper
nourishment of age." Verse was the amusement of youth, and
unless very sparingly used, was unbecoming the gravity of mature
minds.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Milton had another conception of the office of poetry, and
he avowed that his purpose was "to inbreed and cherish in a great
people whatsoever in religion is holy and sublime, in virtue amiable
or grave." Wordsworth was of Milton's school. His aim was, "to
make men wiser, better, and happier." "Every great poet," he said,
"is a teacher; I wish to be considered as a teacher or as nothing."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
The right doctrine was enforced by a critic whom Pope despised.
"Poetry," wrote Dennis, "has two ends,&mdash;a subordinate and a
final one: the subordinate one is pleasure, and the final one is
instruction."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He had the sanction of Lord Bacon, who declared that
"poesy" had three uses, of which two were to inculcate morality
and heroism; the third alone was for "delectation."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Aristotle
long before had contended that poetry was a more effective school of
virtue than philosophy, and Horace avowed his conviction that right
and wrong were taught better by Homer than by the sages. The least
reflection upon the range of the noblest poetry must satisfy anybody
that entertainment is its smallest function. The poet has the world
of external things from which to cull his pictures. He gives definiteness
to what was vague, fixes what was transitory, detects delightful
resemblances, and brings to view unnoticed beauties. He invests
the realities with the thoughts of his impassioned mind, creating in
us sentiments, and supplying us with associations which we should
not have derived from the actual objects. Nature, in itself enchanting,
has meanings for us which were never dreamt of till we
saw it through the medium of the poet's representations. He has
the world of mankind for his province. He can take us the circuit
of the passions; he can summon them from the inner recesses of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
soul, and set them in open array; he can assign to each its rightful
force, stripping corruption of its disguises, and displaying what is
lovely in its unadulterated lustre. He can soar at pleasure into
loftier regions, and when his main theme lies in a lower sphere
can link it, openly or by implication, to the world of spirits,&mdash;to the
divinity and the divine. Verse abounds in the strains which lift the
soul to heaven, or bring down heaven to glorify earth, and sustain
its weakness and woes. In a word, the poet treats of nature, man,
the superhuman, and treats of them in a way which dilates our
faculties and feelings, till through the contemplation of the ideal we
attain to a grander real. "Poesy," says Lord Bacon, "was ever
thought to have some participation of divineness, because it doth raise
and erect the mind, by submitting the shows of things to the desires of
the mind, whereas reason doth buckle and bow the mind unto the
nature of things."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The domain of high poetry is the sublime, the
solemn, the terrible, the pathetic, the tender, the sweet, and the
tranquil; the office of poetry is to purify, to ennoble, to humanise, to
soften, to soothe, and to delight. Poetry is great, and participates of
divineness in proportion as it employs these means, and attains these
ends. The dry unprofitable seeds which lurk in the heart, are by
poetry quickened into a resplendent growth. Through poetry, obscure
vestiges of truth start into distinctness, and flash upon the
inward eye. Through poetry, the ethereal elements of the mind,
incessantly dissipated and deadened by common concerns, are renewed
in their sanctity. In the reach and importance of the lessons
no hard prosaic facts can go beyond exalted poetry. The lesser kinds
have their lesser uses, and chiefly in this that they are often more
attractive in youth than healthier inspirations, and prepare the way
for them. Wordsworth, in his boyhood, was entranced by the false
glitter of famous poems which in his manhood seemed to him "dead
as a theatre fresh emptied of spectators."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Thrown aside when they
had served their purpose, they were the initial sparks which kindled
a spirit that took precedence even of Milton in the depth and compass
of thoughts and feelings almost deserving the name of revelations.</p>


<p class="center">TO MRS.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> ARABELLA FERMOR.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>It will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this
piece, since I dedicate it to you. Yet you may bear me witness,
it was intended only to divert a few young ladies, who have
good sense and good humour enough to laugh not only at
their sex's little unguarded follies, but at their own. But as
it was communicated with the air of a secret, it soon found its
way into the world. An imperfect copy having been offered
to a bookseller, you had the good-nature, for my sake, to consent
to the publication of one more correct. This I was forced
to, before I had executed half my design, for the machinery
was entirely wanting to complete it.</p>

<p>The machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the critics,
to signify that part which the deities, angels, or demons, are
made to act in a poem. For the ancient poets are in one
respect like many modern ladies, let an action be never so
trivial in itself, they always make it appear of the utmost importance.
These machines I determined to raise on a very
new and odd foundation, the Rosicrucian doctrine of spirits.</p>

<p>I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words
before a lady; but it is so much the concern of a poet to have
his works understood, and particularly by your sex, that you
must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rosicrucians are a people I must bring you acquainted
with. The best account I know of them is in a French book,
called Le Comte de Gabalis, which both in its title and size is
so like a novel, that many of the fair sex have read it for one
by mistake. According to these gentlemen the four elements
are inhabited by spirits, which they call sylphs, gnomes,
nymphs, and salamanders. The gnomes or demons of earth
delight in mischief; but the sylphs, whose habitation is in the
air, are the best conditioned creatures imaginable. For they
say, any mortals may enjoy the most intimate familiarities
with these gentle spirits, upon a condition very easy to all
true adepts, an inviolate preservation of chastity.</p>

<p>As to the following cantos, all the passages of them are as
fabulous, as the vision at the beginning, or the transformation
at the end, except the loss of your hair, which I always
mention with reverence. The human persons are as fictitious
as the airy ones; and the character of Belinda, as it is now
managed, resembles you in nothing but in beauty.</p>

<p>If this poem had as many graces as there are in your person,
or in your mind, yet I could never hope it should pass through
the world half so uncensured as you have done. But let its
fortune be what it will, mine is happy enough, to have given
me this occasion of assuring you that I am, with the truest
esteem,</p>

<h2><span class="em1point71">ELEGY</span><br />
<span class="em0point65">TO THE MEMORY OF</span><br />
<span class="em1point76">AN UNFORTUNATE LADY.</span></h2>

<p>See the Duke of Buckingham's verses to a Lady designing to retire
into a Monastery compared with Mr. Pope's Letters to several
Ladies, p. 206 [86], quarto edition. She seems to be the same
person whose unfortunate death is the subject of this poem.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<p>The unfortunate lady seems to have been a particular favourite of
our poet. Whether he himself was the person she was removed
from I am not able to say, but whoever reads his verses to her
memory will find she had a very great share in him. This young
lady who was of quality, had a very large fortune, and was in
the eye of our discerning poet a great beauty, was left under the
guardianship of an uncle, who gave her an education suitable to her
title; for Mr. Pope declares she had titles, and she was thought a
fit match for the greatest peer. But very young she contracted an
acquaintance, and afterwards some degree of intimacy, with a young
gentleman, who is only imagined, and, having settled her affections
there, refused a match proposed to her by her uncle. Spies being
set upon her, it was not long before her correspondence with her
lover of lower degree was discovered, which, when taxed with by her
uncle, she had too much truth and honour to deny. The uncle
finding that she could not, nor would strive to withdraw her regard
from him, after a little time forced her abroad, where she was
received with all due respect to her quality, but kept up from the
sight or speech of anybody but the creatures of this severe guardian,
so that it was impossible for her lover even to deliver a letter that
might ever come to her hand. Several were received from him with
promises to get them privately delivered to her, but those were all
sent to England, and only served to make them more cautious who
had her in care. She languished here a considerable time, went
through a great deal of sickness and sorrow, wept and sighed continually.
At last wearied out, and despairing quite, the unfortunate
lady, as Mr. Pope justly calls her, put an end to her own life.
Having bribed a woman servant to procure her a sword, she was
found dead upon the ground, but warm. The severity of the laws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of the place where she was in denied her Christian burial, and she
was buried without solemnity, or even any to wait on her to her
grave except some young people of the neighbourhood, who saw her put
into common ground, and strewed her grave with flowers, which gave
some offence to the priesthood, who would have buried her in the
highway, but it seems their power there did not extend so far.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ayre.</span></p>

<p>From this account, given with the evident intention to raise the
lady's character, it does not appear that she had any claim to praise,
nor much to compassion. She seems to have been impatient, violent
and ungovernable. Her uncle's power could not have lasted long; the
hour of liberty and choice would have come in time. But her
desires were too hot for delay, and she liked self-murder better than
suspense. Nor is it discovered that the uncle, whoever he was, is
with much justice delivered to posterity as "a false guardian." He
seems to have done only that for which a guardian is appointed; he
endeavoured to direct his niece till she should be able to direct
herself. Poetry has not often been worse employed than in dignifying
the amorous fury of a raving girl. The verses have drawn much attention
by the illaudable singularity of treating suicide with respect;
and they must be allowed to be written in some parts with vigorous
animation, and in others with gentle tenderness; nor has Pope produced
any poem in which the sense predominates more over the
diction. But the tale is not skilfully told; it is not easy to discover
the character of either the lady or her guardian. Pope praises her
for the dignity of ambition, and yet condemns the uncle to detestation
for his pride. The ambitious love of a niece may be opposed by the
interest, malice, or envy of an uncle, but never by his pride. On
such an occasion a poet may be allowed to be obscure, but inconsistency
never can be right.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>I have in my possession a letter to Dr. Johnson, containing the
name of the lady, and a reference to a gentleman well known in the
literary world for her history. Him I have seen, and from a memorandum
of some particulars to the purpose, communicated to him by
a lady of quality, he informs me that the unfortunate lady's name
was Withinbury, corruptly pronounced Winbury; that she was in
love with Pope, and would have married him; that her guardian,
though she was deformed in her person, looking upon such a match
as beneath her, sent her to a convent, and that a noose, and not a
sword, put an end to her life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir John Hawkins.</span></p>

<p>The Elegy to the Memory of an unfortunate lady, as it came
from the heart, is very tender and pathetic&mdash;more so, I think, than any
other copy of verses of our author. The true cause of the excellence
of this elegy is, that the occasion of it was real,&mdash;so true is the maxim
that nature is more powerful than fancy, and that we can always feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
more than we can imagine; and that the most artful fiction must
give way to truth, for this lady was beloved by Pope. After many
and wide enquiries I have been informed that her name was Wainsbury,
and that&mdash;which is a singular circumstance&mdash;she was as ill-shaped
and deformed as our author. Her death was not by a sword,
but, what would less bear to be told poetically, she hanged herself.
Johnson has too severely censured this elegy when he says, "that it
has drawn much attention by the illaudable singularity of treating
suicide with respect." She seems to have been driven to this desperate
act by the violence and cruelty of her uncle and guardian, who
forced her to a convent abroad, and to which circumstance Pope alludes
in one of his letters.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>The real history of the lady distinguished by the epithet "unfortunate"
in Pope's exquisite elegy, is still involved in mysterious uncertainty.
One thing is plain, that he wished little should be known.
It is remarkable that Caryll asks the question in two letters, but Pope
returns no answer. It is in vain, after the fruitless enquiry of
Johnson and Warton, perhaps, to attempt further elucidation; but I
should think it unpardonable not to mention what I have myself
heard, though I cannot vouch for its truth. The story which was
told to Condorcet by Voltaire, and by Condorcet to a gentleman of
high birth and character, from whom I received it, is this:&mdash;that her
attachment was not to Pope, or to any Englishman of inferior degree,
but to a young French prince of the blood royal, Charles Emmanuel,
Duke of Berry, whom, in early youth, she had met at the court of
France. The verses certainly seem unintelligible, unless they allude
to some connection to which her highest hopes, though nobly connected
herself, could not aspire. What other sense can be given to
these words:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs, her soul aspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the vulgar flight of low desire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition first sprung from your bless'd abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious fault of angels and of gods!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>She was herself of a noble family, or there can be no meaning in the
line,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
That once had beauty, <i>titles</i>, wealth and fame.
</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Under the idea here suggested, a greater propriety is given to the
verse, which otherwise appears so tame and common-place,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It sufficiently appears from Pope's letter that she was of a wild and
romantic disposition. She left her friends and country, and commenced
a sentimental pursuit after the object in which her ambition
and enthusiastic caprice had centered. Having alienated her relations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
by her wayward conduct, and being disappointed in the hopes
she had formed, she retired voluntarily to a convent. Warton asserts
that she was "forced" into a nunnery. This is expressly contrary to
what Pope himself says in a letter to her: "If you are resolved in
revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it, I
believe your design to be in vain; for, in a monastery, your devotions
cannot carry you so far towards the next world, as to make this lose
sight of you." It is most probable that incipient lunacy was the cause
of her perverted feelings, and untimely end. Johnson says, "poetry
has been seldom worse employed than in dignifying the amorous fury
of a raving girl." This seems severe, contemptuous, and unfeeling.
Johnson, however, chiefly adverted, I imagine, to the false reasoning
and absurd attempt in the lines "Is there no bright," &amp;c., to make
suicide the natural consequence of more elevated feelings. Johnson
spoke as a severe moralist, and a rigid philosopher, against such contemptible
reasoning as Pope employs upon this subject from the fifth
to the twenty-second verse. Having been, as might naturally be
expected from his superior understanding, disgusted with the reasoning
part of the poem, the gentler touches of fancy and tenderness
were lost, if I may say so, on him. He would turn with disdain from
such images as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>or perhaps exclaim, as upon another occasion, <i>Incredulus odi</i>. Notwithstanding,
however, his severity, the animated passages of this
poem, "But thou, false guardian," &amp;c., and the lines of tenderness
and poetic fancy interspersed, cannot be read without sympathy.
The verses "Yet shall thy grave," &amp;c., are possibly too common-place,
but they are surely beautiful. If any expression might be
objected to, perhaps it would be "silver" for "white" wings of an
angel.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>The Elegy, although produced at an early age, is not exceeded in
pathos and true poetry by any production of its author. But whilst
we admit the extraordinary powers displayed by the poet, we cannot
but perceive that they are apparently employed to give a sanction to
an act of criminality, and to inculcate principles which cannot be too
cautiously guarded against. It must, however, be observed, that this
piece is not to be judged of by the common rules of criticism. It is,
in fact, a spontaneous burst of indignation against the authors of the
calamity which it records. Throughout the whole poem, the author
speaks as if he were under a delusion, and utters sentiments which
would be wholly unpardonable at other times. It is only in this
light that we can excuse the violence of many of the expressions,
which border on the very verge of impiety. The first line of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
poem demonstrates that he is no longer under the control of reason.
He sees the ghost of the person whom he so highly admired and
loved. The "visionary sword" gleams before his eyes, and in the
excess of his grief he perceives nothing but what is great and noble
in the act that terminated her life. This impassioned strain is continued
till his anger is turned against the author of her sufferings,
when it is poured out in one of the most terrific passages which
poetry, either ancient or modern, can exhibit,&mdash;a passage in which
indignation and revenge seem to absorb every other feeling, and to
involve not only the offender, but all who are connected with him, in
indiscriminate destruction. Nor is this sufficient&mdash;their destruction
must be the cause of exultation to others, and they are to become
the objects of insult and abhorrence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Compassion at length succeeds to resentment, and pity to terror.
The poet in some degree assumes his own character, and his feelings
are expressed in language of the deepest affection and tenderness,
which impresses itself indelibly on the memory of the reader. The
concluding lines, whilst they display the ardour of real passion, demonstrate
how greatly the author was attached to the art he professed;
<i>that</i>, and his affection for the object of his grief, could only
expire together;</p>

<p>This poem first appeared in the quarto of 1717, where it bore the
title of "Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady." In the
edition of 1736, "Elegy" was substituted for "Verses." The
earliest historical account of the heroine was given by William Ayre,
Esq., in a miserable compilation called Memoirs of Pope, which is
full of extravagant fictions and blunders.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> This wretched book-maker
has merely turned the incidents of the poem into prose, and amplified
them in the process. His narrative would be unworthy of notice if
it had not been adopted by Ruffhead, who borrowed, without acknowledgment,
the statements, and, in the main, the very language of
Ayre. The authority of Ruffhead's work is entirely due to the fact,
that it was in part drawn up from manuscripts supplied by Warburton,
and was subsequently revised by him. The copy corrected
by the bishop contains no note on the pages which record the fate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the unfortunate lady. It does not follow that he knew the particulars
to be true because he has not declared them to be false. He
was probably ignorant on the subject, and unable either to confirm
or confute the story. Dr. Johnson was in the same position. "The
lady's name and adventures," he says, in his Life of Pope, "I have
sought with fruitless inquiry. I can, therefore, tell no more than I
have learned from Mr. Ruffhead, who writes with the confidence of
one who could trust his information." The trust was fallacious.
Ruffhead, an uncritical transcriber, a blind man led by the blind, was
deceived by a transparent impostor who, in default of facts, embellished
the hints in Pope's verse. His style of invention is emblazoned in
the last sentence of his narrative when he says, that "the priesthood
would have buried the lady in the highway, but it seems their power
there did not extend so far." The law of England till the reign
of George IV. ordained that a suicide, unless irresponsible from
insanity, should be interred in the highway, and a stake driven
through the body. Pope, in his poem, only spoke of "unpaid
rites," whence Ayre, alias Curll, concluded that the law of the place
did not sanction road-burial. Familiar, however, with the English
notion he transfers it to the priests of a locality where the usage, by
his own confession, did not exist.</p>

<p>Nearly half a century after the death of the poet, Hawkins and
Warton, who evidently derived their statements from a common
source, produced a legend, which instead of being drawn from the
elegy is directly opposed to it. Pope says that the unfortunate lady
destroyed herself with a sword, Warton that she put an end to her
life with a rope; Pope says that she had beauty, Warton that she
was deformed: Pope says that she had titles, Warton that she was
simply one Wainsbury; Pope says that she had fame, and Warton
has quoted a name so obscure that nobody has been able to discover
her lineage, her connections, her residence, or that she was ever
known to a single human being of the time. The Warton form of
the romance has been jotted down by the Duchess of Portland in her
note book, from which it appears that the narrators did not agree
among themselves; for Warton declares that the lady was beloved by
Pope; the duchess that Pope was beloved by the lady, and that he
did not return her affection. In his Essay on the Genius of Pope,
Warton states that her first suitor was the Duke of Buckingham, that
on his deserting her she retired into a convent in France, and that
her retreat into a nunnery prompted the poet, "who had conceived a
violent passion for her," to express his feelings in the Epistle of Eloisa
to Abelard.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> The Duke of Buckingham, on March 16, 1705, married
his third wife, who survived him. The tone and details of the Elegy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
forbid the notion that it could have been written on a cast-off mistress
of the duke, and the incidents must, therefore, have occurred before
March 16, 1705, when Pope was barely sixteen years and ten months
old. The fable thus requires us to suppose that the Epistle of Eloisa
to Abelard was the production of a lad of seventeen, that it was composed
several years before the translation of the letters existed from
which he has borrowed a considerable part of the phraseology as well
as the ideas, and that his virulent denunciation of the "false guardian,"
was for not allowing a ward "with beauty, titles, wealth, and
fame," to wed the son of a linen-draper,&mdash;a mere boy without money,
reputation, or prospects, and who was deformed and stunted in an
extreme degree.</p>

<p>In 1806, Bowles promulgated a tradition which contradicts the
representations both of Ayre and Warton. The hero of Warton is
Pope himself; the hero of Bowles is the Duke of Berry. The heroine
of Warton in one version, for he is not consistent, was forced into a
convent; and the heroine of Bowles withdrew there of her own
accord. The unfortunate lady of Ayre and Ruffhead is driven abroad
by her uncle, that she may be weaned from an English attachment;
the unfortunate lady of Bowles falls in love with a foreigner on the
continent; the lady of Ayre and Ruffhead is thwarted in her matrimonial
schemes because she has fixed her heart upon a person
beneath her; and the lady of Bowles is reduced to despair because
she aspires to the hand of a person above her. Bowles maintains
that the latter view must be received or the Elegy is unintelligible.
Johnson has shown that the Elegy is contradictory, and if the verses
which represent the lady's fate to have been the consequence of her
ambition favours the theory that she was enamoured of some superior
in rank, the passage which represents the uncle as steeling his heart
against his niece out of pride equally favours the rival hypothesis that
she was devoted to an inferior.</p>

<p>At variance in nearly every particular, the conflicting histories of
the unfortunate lady have the common quality, that they are unsupported
by a single circumstance which could warrant the smallest
measure of belief. Bowles heard his version, for which he declined
to vouch, from an unnamed gentleman, who heard it from Condorcet,
who heard it from Voltaire, who heard it nobody knows where.
Ayre and the rest cite no witnesses whatever, for the obvious reason
that they had none of any value to cite. The only accounts which
give the lady's name report it differently, and not one of the investigators
of her story,&mdash;not even Warton after his "many and wide
enquiries,"&mdash;can tell us where she was born or died, or where she
lived, or to whom she was related or known. The veriest phantom
that ever flitted in darkness before the eye of credulous superstition
could not be more illusive and impalpable.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The biographers and editors who went about enquiring after the
unfortunate lady had no suspicion that she might be altogether a
poetical invention, nor could they have shown that here was the solution
of the mystery unless they had been in possession of the Caryll correspondence.
Pope, in a posthumous note, which was published by
Warburton, directs us to the letters to several ladies at p. 206 of the
quarto edition, for the indications that the unfortunate lady of the
Elegy was also the heroine of the Duke of Buckingham's Verses to
a Lady designing to retire into a Monastery. There are no letters to
ladies at p. 206 of the quarto, but some are inserted from p. 86
to p. 95, and 206 is a palpable misprint for 86, where, in conformity
with the title of the duke's poem, we have a letter to a lady who was
meditating a retreat to a convent. The preceding letter is addressed
to Mr. Caryll, and, in the table of contents, is said to be "Concerning
an unfortunate lady." The letter which relates to the monastic
project is said, in the table of contents, to be "To the same lady,"
and thence it appears that the lady who thought of withdrawing to a
nunnery was the same unfortunate lady who was the subject of the
letter to Caryll. From the Caryll correspondence we discover that
she was the wife of John Weston, Esq., of Sutton, in the county of
Surrey; but, instead of dying by her own hand in a foreign country,
she died a natural death in her native land on the 18th of October,
1724, several years after the poet had commemorated the suicide of
the unfortunate lady.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> It follows that he has falsely represented the
unfortunate lady of his letters to have been the same individual with
the unfortunate lady of the Elegy, and since he was driven to conjure
up a fictitious victim we may be sure that there was no real victim in
the case. This explains Pope's omission to answer Caryll's inquiry
who the unfortunate lady was;<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> this explains why the tragical death
of a woman "with beauty, titles, wealth, and fame," was unknown
to her contemporaries; this explains why the histories of her differ
from each other, and why in every one of them she remains a shadowy
being whose very existence cannot be traced; this explains why, as
Johnson observes, it is not easy to make out from the poem the character
of either the heroine or her guardian: and this accounts for the
contradictions which have crept into the Elegy. Pope adopted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
common incident of a miserable girl having recourse to self-destruction,
and he wished to have it believed that he had a personal interest in
her fate. His disposition to talk of himself in his poetry has been
noticed by Johnson. Windsor Forest, the Essay on Criticism, the
Temple of Fame, the Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard, and the Rape of
the Lock, all ended egotistically. The Elegy was an inviting occasion
for the indulgence of his propensity. He had got, as he thought, a
romantic heroine, and yielding to the temptation to blend his name
with her story, he wound up his verses with the celebration of his
devoted attachment to her. He laid the scene of her death abroad
to account for English ignorance of the tragedy, and he endeavoured
to authenticate the fable for posterity by a posthumous note which
involved the assumption that the unfortunate lady of his letters was
the same lady commemorated in his poem. The note which was designed
to accredit the tale has answered the opposite purpose, and
convicted him of a puerile deception, not the mere impulse of youthful
vanity, but renewed on the brink of the grave, with a final sense
of satisfaction in propping up and perpetuating the petty fraud.</p>

<p>The supposition that the story was true has seduced Warton,
Wakefield, and Roscoe into some weak critical fancies. Warton
thinks the Elegy the most pathetic of Pope's writings, and says
"that the cause of its excellence is that the occasion of it was real."
Wakefield remarks that the text of the latest edition does not differ
from the earliest, and conjectures that "the author's interest in
the subject rendered the poem too affecting for his own perusal."
Roscoe, to excuse the principles inculcated in the piece, alleges that
it was "a spontaneous burst of indignation," and that "the first line
demonstrates that Pope was no longer under the control of reason."
Similar causes have dissimilar effects. Unfortunate ladies who are
"no longer under the control of reason" are prone to stab or hang
themselves. When Pope is "no longer under the control of reason"
he sits down and writes an elegy which Roscoe says "is not exceeded
in pathos and true poetry by any production of its author." Had
the grief been as genuine as it was imaginary the apology is manifestly
futile; for the man whose mind is sufficiently calm to permit
him to sing his woes in polished verse, must have passed beyond the
stage when he is incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. The
plea might have justified the sentiments in a drama where the speaker
was represented as pouring out his feelings while the calamity was
fresh, but in an elegy the poet embodies his own opinions at the time
of composition, and the bad morality becomes deliberate doctrine.</p>

<p>Vague and sounding verse could not lend a momentary speciousness
to the sophistries of the Elegy. That the transgression of the
angels was ambition is a common, though an unauthorised idea.
That their sin was "glorious" is a notion peculiar to Pope. This

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
"glorious fault" they infused into the unfortunate lady and "bade
her soul aspire." The particular aspiration they suggested to her was
to marry out of her sphere; her lofty ambition was an inordinate
desire to make a good worldly match. Thwarted in the magnanimous
purpose of her life, she had the second great merit of an heroic
death; for to commit suicide was, in Pope's opinion, "to think
greatly," "to die bravely," "to act a Roman's part." The exalted
representation will not stand before the annals of suicide. They bear
daily witness that self-destruction is the refuge of diseased, weak,
pusillanimous, conscience-stricken minds.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> The want of fortitude is
proportioned to the slightness of the disaster which prompts the deed.
What is remediable may be more readily endured than what cannot
be cured, and there could be no stronger mark of a childish, self-indulgent,
unhealthy character, without force or dignity, the slave of
impulse, than that a woman should be guilty of suicide because her
guardian refused his consent to an unequal marriage. There might
be much room for pity; there could be none for admiration. The
strength of affection which could be the only redeeming element is
eliminated by the poet who, in this part of the Elegy, resolves the
lady's love into the ignoble craving to marry into a higher station
than her own. Her worldly disposition is the evidence to Pope
that she had "a purer spirit" than such "kindred dregs" as had
not sufficient grandeur of mind to worship rank. Out of compassion
for her superiority "fate snatched her early away," that she might
not be doomed to associate with the "dull souls" who love their
equals, and bear their trials with resignation.</p>

<p>The opening lines of the Elegy have some of the indefiniteness
which Johnson censured in the portrayal of the lady and her guardian.
A female ghost with a gored and bleeding bosom, and bearing a
visionary sword, beckons the poet to go with her into a glade. For
what purpose does she beckon him? The apparition may be supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to be the creature of a heated imagination, but there should be
some significance in the act ascribed to her. The ghost of the King
of Denmark did not beckon Horatio or the sentinels. It passed by
them with "a slow and stately march," and made no sign, till Hamlet
was present at its fourth appearance, and then</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
It beckoned him to go away with it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it some impartment did desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him alone.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The ghost of the unfortunate lady imparted no information to Pope,
for he avows his ignorance of everything relating to her ghostly condition.
A passage in Milton's Comus, separated from the context,
might seem to countenance the indiscriminate use of the epithet
"beckoning," as if it were a general characteristic of spectres.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i16">

</div></div></div>

<p>A superstition attached to "desert wildernesses," where the wanderer
who lost sight of his associates could seldom strike into their track
on the pathless waste, was made known to Milton by the travels of
Marco Polo. "If," says the old Venetian, in his account of the
great Asiatic desert, Lop or Gobi, "any one at night stays behind, or
diverges from his company, he hears, when he wishes to rejoin it,
spirits speaking in the air, who seem to be his comrades, and sometimes
call him by his name, beguiling him out of the right road, so
that many continue to go astray and perish."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The lady in Comus
was in a like situation. She was benighted, she had lost her way, she
heard "the tumult of loud mirth," and when she reached the spot from
whence the merriment proceeded she found "nought but darkness."
Then the "calling shapes, and beck'ning shadows dire," that lure poor
wanderers to destruction, rushed into her thoughts, and she conceived
she might be the dupe of malignant phantoms.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Pope's beckoning
ghost was not of this class of "dire" counterfeit "shadows." She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
is represented as an honest, sympathising spirit, who could never
have designed to entice her lover or friend into the glade with a
murderous intent. Warton quotes the commencement of Ben Jonson's
Epitaph on Lady Winchester, which Pope must have had in his
mind when he wrote his Elegy. The ghost beckoned Jonson to pluck
a garland from the yew tree.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> A spirit could not have revisited the
world, for a more frivolous purpose, but at least the poet felt that he
must assign a cause for the beckoning. The omission in Pope arose
from a frequent source of misapplied language. Isolated lines and
phrases, which had the sanction of classic authors, lingered in his
memory, and he forgot the accompaniments to which they owed their
fitness.</p>

<p>The spectacle of the bleeding ghost of the lady haunting the glade
by moonlight suggests to the poet that she may be doing penance for
her self-inflicted death. He reasons himself into the conviction that
her violence was meritorious, and he concludes that she has been
"snatched to the pitying sky." At ver. 47 comes a couplet in which
the christian idea of a spirit in heaven is superseded by the pagan
notion of an ever "injured shade" to whom nothing can compensate for
the loss of the customary funereal rites. Out of his ambition to imitate
classic poets Pope jumbled discordant creeds together, and introduced
this remnant of an extinct mythology, absurd in itself and
offensive in a modern elegy. The passage which follows, from ver.
51 to ver. 68, is the most pleasing part of the poem, though the ten
lines from ver. 59 have been severely criticised by Lord Kames.
Fictitious topics of consolation were not, he said, "the language of
the heart, but of imagination indulging its flights at ease," and were
incompatible with "the deeply serious and pathetic."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Warburton
criticised the criticism. He said it "smelled furiously of old John
Dennis," and Bowles allowed that it was "absurd." The tone of
Lord Kames is, perhaps, too contemptuous, for the lines have a certain
sweetness of sentiment. Yet he was right when he maintained
that they were not in harmony with the professions of grief and indignation
which follow or go before. All ages and nations have
shared the conviction that the omnipotence behind the phenomena of
nature deputes them on special occasions to speak in exceptional ways
to the affections, hopes, and fears of man. In the rear of these
beliefs are numerous cases in which appearances are accepted for a
symbolical language, not with an absolute faith, but with a fond
acquiescence because they are the just reflection of our thoughts.
Wordsworth's exquisite Hart-leap Well,&mdash;perfect in its descriptive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
power, its easy flow of beautiful English, and its mingled strains of
animation and pathos&mdash;culminates in the creed that the bleakness of
the once luxuriant enclosure in which the stag fell dead, is the protest
of nature against the palace and bowers erected there by the knight in
exultant commemoration of his cruel chase. Wide is the range in
this domain of poetry, from sublimity down to prettinesses, from
prettinesses to poor conceits. What is legitimate in itself may be
wrongly placed, and here is the fault of Pope's lines. Amid the
tempest of sorrow and anger he derives consolation from the notion
that the first roses of the year will blow on the grave of the unfortunate
lady, that the earliest dew-drops of the morning will weep her
loss, that the turf will lie light on her insensate corpse, and that
angels will overshadow in perpetuity the spot of earth which conceals
it. The reveries of fancy may gratify the tranquil mind. They
would be mockery to a man absorbed by terrible realities, to a man
distracted by the suicide of the woman he adored.</p>

<p>The paragraph, "So peaceful rests," was much admired by the
stone-cutters, and with tasteless ignorance they engraved it, slightly
modified, upon hundreds of tombstones. No one in a churchyard
requires to be reminded that its buried population is "a heap of
dust." Amid the visible signs of mortality monuments should soothe
and lift up the mind by speaking of that which is not corruptible&mdash;of
that which was best in the acts, disposition, endurance, and belief
of the dead, or of the contrast between the earthly life that was and
the life that is, between the transitory and the immortal. Improper
for an epitaph, the lines were not unsuited to an elegy, if the final
paragraph had opened up a brighter vista instead of dropping into
the lowest style of heathenism. The affection of the elegy-writer was
to cease with the "idle business" of life, and the dearest object of his
heart would be "beloved by him no more." He had talked of "pale
ghosts," and "bright reversions in the skies," but by the time he
got to the conclusion of his poetical exercise, skies, and ghosts had
faded from his thoughts, and his language would leave the impression
that the "last gasp" was the end of all things. In composition
the Elegy is terse and powerful; the ideas are erroneous, inconsistent,
or inadequate. Pagan and christian notions clash together; the
story is represented under contradictory phases; the dreary close of
the poem sets aside the faith which consoles survivors; the sentiments
at the beginning are false and melodramatic; and the middle,
though not devoid of tenderness, chiefly consists of borrowed fictions,
which are too artificial for the occasion.</p>

<p>The Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard first appeared in the quarto of 1717.
The second edition was accompanied by other poems on kindred subjects&mdash;"Verses
to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady; Florelio, a Pastoral,
lamenting the Death of the late Marquis of Blandford, by Mr. Fenton; Upon
the Death of her Husband, by Mrs. Elizabeth Singer; A Ballad, by Mr.
Gay,&mdash;''Twas when the Seas were roaring;' and Richy and Sandy, a Pastoral
on the Death of Mr. Joseph Addison, by Allan Ramsay." The Epistle
was reprinted in Lintot's Miscellany in 1720, 1722, 1727, and 1732. In
the Miscellany of 1727 there was added for the first time a motto from Prior's
Alma:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Thy fate will justify this truth;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That decked dear Eloisa's face.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lord Bathurst told Warton that Pope was not pleased with these lines, in
which the poet is accused of palliating Eloisa's guilt, and complimented for
the skill with which he did it; but we learn from a letter of Pope to Christopher
Pitt that he himself corrected the sheets of his own pieces in the Miscellany
of 1727, and if the passage from Prior had been distasteful to him, he
would not have prefixed it to the Epistle. The motto was repeated in the
Miscellany of 1732, and was omitted by him in the later editions of his
works.</p>

<p>Of the Epistle from Eloisa to Abelard I do not know the date.
Pope's first inclination to attempt a composition of that tender kind
arose, as Mr. Savage told me, from his perusal of Prior's Nut-brown
Maid. How much he has surpassed Prior's work it is not necessary
to mention, when perhaps it may be said with justice that he has
excelled every composition of the same kind. The mixture of religious
hope and resignation gives an elevation and dignity to disappointed
love which images merely natural cannot bestow. The gloom of a
convent strikes the imagination with far greater force than the solitude
of a grove. This piece was, however, not much his favourite in his
latter years, though I never heard upon what principle he slighted it.
The Epistle is one of the most happy productions of human wit.
The subject is so judiciously chosen that it would be difficult, in
turning over the annals of the world, to find another which so many
circumstances concur to recommend. We regularly interest ourselves
most in the fortunes of those who most deserve our notice; Abelard
and Eloisa were conspicuous in their days for eminence of merit.
The heart naturally loves truth; the adventures and misfortunes of
this illustrious pair are known from undisputed history. Their fate
does not leave the mind in hopeless dejection, for they both found
quiet and consolation in retirement and piety. So new and so
affecting is their story that it supersedes invention, and imagination
ranges at full liberty without straggling into scenes of fable. The
story thus skilfully adopted, has been diligently improved. Pope has
left nothing behind him which seems more the effect of studious
perseverance and laborious revisal. Here is particularly observable
the <i>curiosa felicitas</i>, a fruitful soil and careful cultivation. Here is
no crudeness of sense, nor asperity of language.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>Of all stories, ancient or modern, there is not, perhaps, a more
proper one to furnish out an elegiac epistle than that of Eloisa and
Abelard. Their distresses were of a most singular and peculiar kind,
and their names sufficiently known, but not grown trite or common
by too frequent usage. Pope was a most excellent improver, if no
great original inventor, and we see how finely he has worked up the
hints of distress that are scattered up and down in Abelard and
Eloisa's letters, and in a little French history of their lives and misfortunes.
Abelard was reputed the most handsome, as well as the
most learned man, of his time, according to the kind of learning then
in vogue. An old chronicle, quoted by Andrew du Chesne, informs
us, that scholars flocked to his lectures from all quarters of the Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
world; and his contemporary, St. Bernard, relates, that he numbered
among his disciples many principal ecclesiastics and cardinals at the
court of Rome. Abelard himself boasts, that when he retired into
the country, he was followed by such immense crowds of scholars
that they could get neither lodgings nor provisions sufficient for them.
He met with the fate of many learned men, to be embroiled in controversy,
and accused of heresy; for St. Bernard, whose influence
and authority were very great, got his opinion of the Trinity condemned
at a council held at Sens, 1140. But the talents of Abelard
were not confined to theology, jurisprudence, philosophy, and the
thorny paths of scholasticism. He gave proofs of a lively genius by
many poetical performances, insomuch that he was reputed to be the
author of the famous Romance of the Rose, which, however, was
indisputably written by John of Meun, a little city on the banks of
the Loire, about four miles from Orleans. It was he who continued
and finished the Romance of the Rose, which William de Lorris had
left imperfect forty years before. There is undoubted evidence that
[the earliest portion] was written an hundred years after Abelard
flourished, and if chronology did not absolutely contradict the notion
of his being the author of this very celebrated piece, yet are there
internal arguments sufficient to confute it. There are many severe
and satirical strokes on the character of Eloisa which the pen of
Abelard never would have given. In one passage she is introduced
speaking with indecency and obscenity; in another all the vices and
bad qualities of women are represented as assembled together in her
alone:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Qui les m&oelig;urs féminins savoit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Car tres-tous en soi les avoit.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In a very old epistle dedicatory, addressed to Philip IV. of France by
this same John of Meun, and prefixed to a French translation of
Boetius, it appears that he also translated the epistles of Abelard to
Heloisa, which were in high vogue at the court. It is to be regretted
that we have no exact picture of the person and beauty of Eloisa.
Abelard himself says that she was "facie non infima."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Her
extraordinary learning many circumstances concur to confirm; particularly
one, which is, that the nuns of the Paraclete are wont to
have the office of Whitsunday read to them in Greek, to perpetuate
the memory of her understanding that language. A lady learned as
was Eloisa in that age, who indisputably understood the Latin, Greek,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and Hebrew tongues, was a kind of prodigy.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Her literature, says
Abelard, "in toto regno nominatissimam fecerat," and we may be
sure more thoroughly attached him to her. Bussy Rabutin speaks in
high terms of commendation of the purity of Eloisa's latinity,&mdash;a
judgment worthy a French count. There is a force but not an
elegance in her style, which is blemished, as might be expected, by
many phrases unknown to the pure ages of the Roman language, and
by many Hebraisms borrowed from the translation of the Bible.</p>

<p>However happy and judicious the subject of Pope's Epistle may be
thought to be, as displaying the various conflicts and tumults between
duty and pleasure, between penitence and passion, that agitated the
mind of Eloisa, yet we must candidly own that the principal circumstance
of distress is of so indelicate a nature, that it is with difficulty
disguised by the exquisite art and address of the poet. The capital
and unrivalled beauties of the poem arise from the striking images and
descriptions of the convent, and from the sentiments drawn from the
mystical books of devotion, particularly Madame Guion, and the
Archbishop of Cambray.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The Epistle is on the whole, one of the
most highly finished, and certainly the most interesting of the pieces
of our author; and, together with the Elegy to the Memory of an
Unfortunate Lady, is the only instance of the pathetic Pope has
given us. I think one may venture to remark that the reputation of
Pope as a poet among posterity will be principally owing to his
Windsor Forest, his Rape of the Lock, and his Eloisa to Abelard,
whilst the facts and characters alluded to and exposed in his later
writings, will be forgotten and unknown, and their poignancy and
propriety little relished. For wit and satire are transitory and
perishable, but nature and passion are eternal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Pope must be judged according to the rank in which he stands,&mdash;among
those of the French school, not the Italian; among those whose
delineations are taken more from manners than from nature. When
I say that this is his predominant character, I must be insensible to
everything exquisite in poetry if I did not except the Epistle to
Eloisa; but this can only be considered according to its class, and if
I say that it seems to me superior to any other of the kind to which
it might fairly be compared, such as the Epistles of Ovid, Propertius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Tibullus (I will not mention Drayton, and Pope's numerous subsequent
Imitations)&mdash;but when this transcendent poem is compared with
those which will bear the comparison, I shall not be deemed as giving
reluctant praise, when I declare my conviction of its being infinitely
superior to everything of the kind, ancient or modern. In this poem,
therefore, Pope appears on the high ground of the poet of nature, but
this certainly is not his general character. In the particular instance
of this poem how distinguished and superior does he stand. It is
sufficient that nothing of the kind has ever been produced equal to it
for pathos, painting, and melody. The mellifluence and solemn
cadence of the verse, the dramatic transitions, the judicious contrasts,
the language of genuine passion, uttered in the sweetest flow of
music, and the pervading solemnity and grandeur of the picturesque
scenery, give the Epistle a wonderful charm, and exemplify Pope's
observation in his Essay on Criticism, "there is a <i>happiness</i> as well as
care." The inherent indelicacy of the subject is one objection to it,
and who but must lament its immoral effect, for of its beauty there
can be but one sentiment. It may be said of it with truth in the
language of its author:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
It lives, it breathes, it speaks what love inspires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and as long as the English language remains, it will</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i4">
Call down tears through every age.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Pope I have no doubt wrote the Epistle to Sappho, and this of Eloisa,
under the impression of strong personal feelings. It is supposed the
subject was suggested by the unfortunate young lady going into a
convent, whose untimely death occasioned the beautiful Elegy,
"What beck'ning ghost;" but I cannot help thinking the real
circumstance that occasioned these touching effusions was his early
attachment to Lady Mary W. Montagu. The concluding lines allude
to her, as I think is evident from his letter. Speaking of a volume
he had sent her when abroad, he adds, "Among the rest you have
all I am worth, that is, my works. There are few things in them
but what you have already seen, except the Epistle of Eloisa to
Abelard, in which you will find one passage that I cannot tell whether
to wish you should understand or not." The lines could not be
meant for the unfortunate lady, for she was dead and forgotten&mdash;could
not relate to Martha Blount, for he was not "condemned
whole years in absence to deplore," and therefore they could be
addressed only to Lady Mary; and "he best shall paint them who
shall feel them most," was a direct allusion to his own ardent but
hopeless passion.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Mr. Bowles has represented the Epistle from Eloisa to Abelard as
being of an immoral tendency. It must however be observed, that if
this construction be put upon the poem, it is what the author never
intended. On the contrary, his object is to show the fatal consequences
of an ungovernable passion; and if he has done this in
natural and even glowing language, it must be remembered that such
are not his own sentiments, but those of the person he has undertaken
to represent, and are in general given in nearly her own words. That
many expressions and passages may be pointed out which are inconsistent
with the established order and regulations of society, may be
fully admitted. Such, for instance, as the lines</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
How oft, when pressed to marriage, have I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curse on all laws but those which love has made!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But surely it is not likely that such sentiments can impose upon the
weakest and most inexperienced minds. It is indeed highly probable
that Pope has in some few instances intentionally exaggerated the
sentiments and expressions of Eloisa in order to render it impossible
for any person of common capacity to be misled by such statements.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span></p>

<p>In 1693 there appeared at the Hague a French translation of the
Latin letters of Abelard and Heloisa. The work was several times
reprinted, and a later editor, M. Du Bois, informs the reader that
the translator had taken the liberty to omit, to add, and to transpose
at his pleasure. "Some of the thoughts and expressions which are
ascribed to Heloisa," continues M. Du Bois, "are so well imagined
that if we are disappointed at not finding them in the original, and
at her not having said the things she has been made to say, we are
agreeably forced to acknowledge that they might have been said by
her, and it is impossible not to be grateful to the paraphrast for his
boldness." The original correspondence contains some interesting
facts, much spurious rhetoric, and many dull pedantic quotations.
The work in its integrity was not adapted for popular reading, but as
the whole value of the letters depended on their genuineness, they
were nearly worthless in their altered form. In 1714 Hughes, the
author of the Siege of Damascus, translated the adulterate French
concoction, and from the phraseology and substance of Pope's Epistle,
it is manifest that he followed the English version of Hughes. Wakefield
and Warton have only looked for parallel passages in the Latin,
where they will often be sought in vain.</p>

<p>The authenticity of the Latin letters has usually been taken for
granted, but I have a strong belief that they are a forgery. The
first letter is addressed by Abelard to a friend in misfortune, for the
purpose of consoling him with a tale of greater woes. The sequel is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
not in keeping with the ostensible object. The autobiographical
epistle is full of vain-glorious, irrelevant matter, which no one would
have recorded whose intention was merely to soothe a sorrow-stricken
man. The particulars relative to Abelard's intercourse with Heloisa
are worse than gratuitous; they are abominable. The intrigue
might be public; he might avow and deplore it; but some reserve
was due to decency and his paramour. She was not an anonymous
phantom who could not be reached by his revelations. He told her
name, and her connections which, according to his narrative, were
notorious already, and he was, therefore, forbidden by such honour
as even exists among profligates to expose the secret details of her
shame. But honour was unknown to him. The veil which rakes
who gloated over past misdeeds would have scorned to draw aside
was torn away by this pious penitent with treacherous baseness.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
The disguise is thinly worn. The Abelard of the letter is not the
contrite, sorrowing philosopher who is speaking of a gifted woman he
had enthusiastically loved, and against whom he had deeply sinned.
He is an unimpassioned author who founds a fiction upon a true
story, and realising imperfectly the sentiments proper to the situation,
relates what he thinks was likely to have happened without perceiving
that the confessions would have been infamy in Abelard.</p>

<p>His letter in some unexplained manner got round to Heloisa. She
might be expected to be filled with rage and humiliation, and she sends
a glowing response to the degrading recital. She outstripped Abelard
in shameless frankness. Madame Guizot asserts that "she expresses
much more in saying much less, that she recalls, but does not
specify,"<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> the truth being that some particulars in her second letter
are grosser and more precise than anything which proceeded from the
pen of Abelard. The plea that her confessions were made to a
husband is no extenuation, since she left his previous revelations
unrebuked, and the approval of <i>his</i> disclosures was a licence to show
about <i>hers</i>. What is more, her champions discover ample evidence in
her letters that they were intended for publication. "Heloisa,"
says Madame Guizot, "supplies details with the exactness of a dramatic
personage obliged to give an account of certain facts to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
audience. There are few letters of the period which have not the
stamp of a literary composition destined to a public sufficiently large
to render it necessary to put them in possession of the circumstances.
If any persons are surprised that Heloisa could design the revelations
in her first and especially in her second letter, for any eye but that of
Abelard, let them read the incidents she could see recounted without
offence in the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>, and they will be convinced of
the existence of a state of manners in which elevated and even
delicate sentiments in a distinguished and naturally modest woman
might be allied to the strangest forms of language."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> The case is
put inaccurately. The "sentiments" are not "delicate;" they are
coarser than the language. The reasoning of Madame Guizot is
equally defective. An immodest act is declared to be modest because
Heloisa had committed a previous act of immodesty. Her toleration
of Abelard's grossness is the evidence of her purity in imitating his
freedoms. The appeal should have been to independent works of the
time, and these are opposed to the theory of Madame Guizot.
Language was often plainer than at present, but only creatures of the
disgusting type of the Wife of Bath proclaimed the hidden details of
their <i>own</i> sexual licentiousness. The reputable classes had risen
high above the point at which elemental decency and self-respect
become extinct. Heloisa must, indeed, have been a woman of
an "unbashful forehead," to use the expression of Shakespeare, if
she deliberately placed herself before the public as she appears in the
letters. It is far more likely that they are the fabrication of an
unconcerned romancer, who speaks in the name of others with a
latitude which people, not entirely degraded, would never adopt towards
themselves. The suspicion is strengthened when the second party to
the correspondence, the chief philosopher of his generation, exhibits
the same exceptional depravity of taste. The improbability is great
that both should have courted a disgraceful notoriety. The correspondence
was coined in one mint; the impress it bears is male, and
not female; and we may apply to Heloisa the words of Rosalind,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">

<span class="i0">This is a man's invention, and his hand.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No portion of them, if they are genuine, can do honour to her memory.
The coarse particulars she divulged to the public would
prove that she was debased, and any sentiments which might have
been creditable in an artless effusion addressed to Abelard lose their
value when they are a studied rhetorical manifesto, got up to produce
an impression on the world.</p>



<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
According to the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i> Abelard was the eldest son
of a soldier in Brittany. His father, who had a tincture of learning,
imbued him with a passion for study. He renounced the weapons
of war for those of logic, resigned his paternal inheritance to his
brothers, and traversed the kingdom that he might engage in scholastic
tournaments at the towns on his road. He arrived at Paris
about the year 1100, when he was twenty-one. There he frequented
the lectures of William of Champeaux, the most famous dialectician
of the day. Soon the pupil questioned the doctrines of his master,
and was often victorious in their public disputations. He established
a rival school, and the credit of all other teachers was lost in his
renown. William of Champeaux, devoured with envy, struggled for
years to drive his antagonist from the field. The invincible Abelard
never failed to defeat him, and finally reigned without a competitor.</p>

<p>When his supremacy was recognised in the domain of metaphysical
logic, he turned his attention to theology, and proceeding to Laon
he sat under Anselm, who was esteemed the foremost divine in the
church. The author of the letter affirms that his instruction consisted
of fine words without matter, smoke without flame, leaves without
fruit. Abelard soon relaxed in his attendance, and expressed his
surprise to his fellow-students that any aid should be used beyond
the text and the gloss in interpreting the Bible. With a derisive
laugh they enquired if he would be bold enough, on these terms,
to become the expositor. He accepted the challenge, and they
thought to baffle him by allotting him the book of Ezekiel. He
replied by inviting them to hear his commentary the following
morning. They recommended him to take time, and he answered
that his habit was to prevail by force of mind, and not by labour.
His audience was small the next day, for it was considered ridiculous
that a young man, who had hardly looked into the Bible, should
extemporise an explanation of its obscurest prophecies. The few
who went were fascinated, and their praises caused his lecture-room
to be thronged. The old story was re-enacted. The pupil who had
vanquished the most celebrated metaphysician of his generation,
now at the first onset eclipsed the greatest theologian in Europe.
Anselm, like William of Champeaux, was filled with jealousy, and
forbade him to continue his disquisitions at Laon.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris, and taught dialectics and divinity with equal
distinction. He had money and glory, he says, in profusion; he
imagined that he was the only philosopher on earth; and in the
words of the letter which bears his name, he was consumed by the
fever of pride and luxury. In this state of worldly prosperity he
reached his thirty-sixth year, when he formed his connection with
Heloisa, who was barely eighteen. His qualifications for amorous
intrigue are related by him with just the same boastful assurance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
with which he describes his dictatorship in the schools. He declares
that his youth, his fame, and his handsome person gave him such a
superiority over all other men, that no woman could resist him.
Whoever she might be she would have thought herself honoured by
his love; and the context shows that the love he meant was illicit.
The learning of Heloisa obtained her the preference, and he deliberately
formed a plan to seduce her. She resided with her uncle
Fulbert, a canon of the cathedral at Paris, who doated on money and
his niece. Abelard appealed to the double passion. Professing to
desire a release from household cares, he offered to board and lodge
with the canon on any terms he chose to ask, and to devote his leisure
hours to the instruction of Heloisa. Fulbert was delighted. He
confided, to use the language of the letter, the tender lamb to the
ravenous wolf, and enjoined the tutor to administer corporal punishment
when his pupil neglected her studies. The comment of Abelard,
or his representative, is extraordinary. He marvels at the simplicity
of the canon in entrusting him with an authority which would
enable him, if Heloisa resisted his fondness, to subdue her by blows.
He thinks Fulbert childishly credulous for not divining that the
grand luminary of philosophy and divinity was a wretch of fiendish
depravity&mdash;a demon who would adopt the brutal expedient of
beating an innocent girl into submission to his wicked designs. In
his third letter he acknowledges that he had put the method in
practice when the temporary scruples of his victim prevailed.</p>

<p>During the frenzy of his passion Abelard was indifferent to literary
glory. His lectures were a burthen to him, and he only cared to compose
amatory songs, which he informs his friend are still popular in
numerous countries. Heloisa says in her reply that, as the greater
part of these poems celebrated their love, her name became famous,
and the jealousy of the women was roused. This is one of the many
improbabilities of the story. At the exact period that Abelard, by
his own acknowledgment, was anxious to conceal his passion from
Fulbert, he published it in popular ballads to the world. The inconsistency
is too glaring. A second statement is more consonant with
human nature. The nerveless lectures, and preoccupied air of Abelard
betrayed his infatuation to his disciples. They divined the
truth; the intrigue was noised abroad, and the rumour at last got
round to Fulbert. Abelard asserts that he and his concubine were
overwhelmed with anguish and shame on their detection; Heloisa
that her amour was the envy of princesses and queens. The
apocryphal writer, after the manner of his tribe, overlooked these
discrepancies.</p>

<p>When the first shock of disgrace was past, the lovers disregarded
appearances, and carried on their intercourse without disguise. The
poor canon was nearly mad between grief and rage, and Abelard

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to appease him led Heloisa to the altar, on the understanding
that their union should be kept a secret; but the relations of the
bride broke their promise, and proclaimed that she was married.
She protested it was false, and Fulbert, exasperated by her denial,
treated her harshly. Her husband removed her to the abbey of
Argenteuil, near Paris, that she might be safe from persecution.
Her friends conjectured that his object was to get rid of her, and in
revenge for his former treachery and present heartlessness, Fulbert
bribed some miscreants to mutilate him when he was asleep. Overwhelmed
with mortification, he resolved to hide his head in a convent,
and selected St. Denis. His jealousy would not suffer him to leave
Heloisa free, and before he bound himself by an irrevocable vow he
obliged her to take the veil.</p>

<p>The monks in Abelard's new retreat led the dissolute life in which he
himself had indulged up to the moment of his disaster. He provoked
their hostility by his remonstrances, and to get rid of him they joined in
the entreaties of his disciples that he would leave his cell, and resume
his lectures. The concourse of hearers was so great that the district
where he set up his chair could not afford them food and lodging.
The popularity of his teaching is attested by independent evidence,
although his extant treatises are bald in style, prolix and cloudy in
exposition, abstruse and barren in substance. But manuscripts were
scarce; the multitude were chiefly dependent upon oral instruction;
literature was almost unknown, and the subtleties of a meagre metaphysical
system applied to theology, had a charm for active intellects
when theology, logic, and metaphysics had undivided possession of the
schools. Controversy lent its powerful aid, animating the dry bones
with the fiery life of human passion. The superiority of Abelard in
the verbal strife was due to the comparative feebleness of his adversaries,
and not to the absolute greatness of his acute, but narrow and
unprolific mind. "How is it," said a nobleman to Lely, "that you
are so celebrated, when you know, as well as I do, that you are no
painter?" "True," replied Lely, "but I am the best you have."</p>

<p>The revival of Abelard's popularity was attended by the old
results. Rival schools were deserted, envy, malice, and hatred were
inflamed. Applying his metaphysical logic to the doctrines of the
Bible he produced a treatise on the Trinity, which he asserts solved
every difficulty; and the more transcendent was the mystery, the
greater, he says, was the admiration at the acuteness of his solution.
But it was by altering the dogma that he brought it down to the level
of human reason, and a council at Soissons accused him of heresy.
If the letter is to be credited, his antagonists paid him the compliment
of refusing to hear his defence, on the plea that his arguments would
confound the united world. The assembly voted him guilty, and the
troubles which grew out of his condemnation ended in his withdrawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
to an uninhabited district on the banks of the river Ardusson, where
he constructed an oratory of reeds and mud. Admiring crowds
pursued him into his desolate retreat. Sleeping in rude huts, and
subsisting on bread and herbs, they abjured the physical luxuries of
existence for the mental feast of listening to the arid speculations in
vogue. His auditors replaced his oratory by a larger building of
wood and stone, which might serve for a lecture-room, and he
named it the Paraclete, or the Comforter, because Providence had
sent him consolation to the spot whither he had fled in despair.
He, or his personator on his behalf, cannot suppress the usual
vaunts. His body, he says, was concealed by his seclusion, but
he filled the universe by his word and his renown. His enemies
were enraged, and groaned inwardly, "Behold the world is gone
after him, and our persecution has increased his glory." He
admits that the sentiment did not fall from their lips, and it is
merely the form in which his vanity embodied their feelings. The
celebrated St. Bernard entered the lists against him, and Abelard
began to be deserted by his adherents. He completely lost heart, and
when the monks of a remote abbey on the coast of Brittany appointed
him their head, he was glad to embrace a banishment which removed
him from the midst of his increasing foes. New enmities awaited
him. As at St. Denis, he soon became odious to his brethren by
reproving their laxity. Their vindictive rage knew no bounds.
They poisoned his food, but he forbore to taste it. They poisoned
the chalice at the altar, but he did not drink of it. They
suborned a servant to poison his victuals when he was on a visit
to his brother, and again he happened not to eat of the dish, while
a monk who partook of it died on the spot. Wherever he went they
posted hired assassins on the road, and for some untold reason he
always escaped. He procured the expulsion of the most desperate
of his bloodthirsty children, and when the remainder were about to
stab him he eluded their daggers. The sword, when he wrote, was
still hanging over his head, and he passed his days in almost
breathless fear. The early novelist who composed the apocryphal
correspondence had the art to leave him in this critical situation.
But the Abelard of the autobiography is a repulsive hero of romance,
since even the penitent is boastful, coarse, and callous.</p>

<p>The abbey of Argenteuil, where Heloisa was prioress, was a dependency
of the abbey of St. Denis. The parent monastery reclaimed
the building and turned out Heloisa and the nuns. Abelard invited
them to meet him at the Paraclete, and he established them in the
oratory and its appurtenances, which had remained unoccupied since
he settled in Brittany. He took frequent journeys from his abbey
to instruct and console them, till finding that his visits gave rise to
scandal, he went no more. Heloisa had not seen him or heard from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
him for a considerable period, when his letter to the unknown friend
fell by accident into her hands, and she immediately replied to it.
Her character, whether drawn by herself or some fabricator who wrote
in her name, comes out clearly in the correspondence. Abelard
states that she laboured to dissuade him from marriage when he
informed her of his promise to Fulbert after the detection of the
intrigue. She said that it would be dishonourable for a philosopher,
whom nature had created for the world, to be enslaved to a woman,
and submitted to the ignominious yoke of matrimony. She said that
his renown would be diminished, that his future career would be
checked, that the church would be injured, and that she could
have no pride in a union which would degrade both of them by
tarnishing his glory. In her answer she confirms his representations;
and adds, that if the name of wife was holier, she held that
of mistress, concubine, or harlot, to be sweeter, not only for the
reasons which Abelard had recapitulated, but because she hoped
that the less she made herself the more she would rise in his favour.
Dean Milman is in error when he asserts that she "resisted the marriage
in an absolute, unrivalled spirit of devotion, so wonderful that
we forget to reprove."<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> She did not overlook her personal interests,
but believed that the concubine would enjoy more love and consideration
than the wife. The theory of her willingness to be sacrificed
that her admirer might be elevated has arisen from the inference,
contradicted by her language, that she felt the disgrace of her illicit
connection. Nothing could be more remote from her thoughts.
She was proud of the distinction.</p>

<p>At the date of her letters Heloisa had been leading for years a
monastic life, which she embraced against her will at the command
of her husband. She had not been refined by misfortune, time,
and religion. She continued to bewail her sensual deprivations, and
the picture she draws of her subjection to her voluptuous imagination,
exceeds anything which could have been expected from the most
dissolute libertine. But none of these things repel the partisans of
historic romance, and the frail unhappy woman seduced by Abelard
is held up as a signal example of feminine excellence. "This noble
creature," says M. Cousin, "loved as Saint Theresa, and sometimes
wrote as Seneca."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> "Her contemporaries," says M. Rémusat,
"placed her above all women, and I do not know that posterity has
belied her contemporaries"<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> "France," says M. Henri Martin,
"has always felt the grandeur of Heloisa, and the just instinct of the
public has numbered the mistress of Abelard among our national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
glories."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Her admirers would be puzzled to explain in what her
pre-eminence consists. Her devotion to her lover is a quality which
she shares with myriads of women, bad as well as good, and her distinctive
moral traits are those in which she differs from the majority
of her sex by being vastly worse instead of better. A modern Heloisa
who pursued the same conduct and avowed the same principles and
passions would be branded with infamy.</p>

<p>The Epistle of Pope purports to be Heloisa's reply to Abelard's letter
to his friend; but the poet has blended in his composition whatever
topics were suited to his purpose, and ascribed sentiments to the wife
which he had copied from the husband. There is nothing in the
work to indicate that the author had read the Latin text, since he
always adheres to the English rendering of the corrupted French
version. Bishop Horne held that the original prose was finer than
Pope's verse.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> I cannot assent to this judgment. The poem has the
superiority in every particular&mdash;in the beauty of the language, in the
picturesqueness of the descriptions, in the fervour of the contrasted
passions, in the animation of the transitions, in the solemnity of the
accompaniments, and above all, in the pathos. The singularity of
Horne's estimate may be explained by his imperfect recollection of the
productions he criticised. To the allegation of Sir John Hawkins,
that matrimony was depreciated and concubinage justified in the
poetical epistle, he replies, that the censure "is founded on a false
fact, because Abelard was married." The observation is a proof that
Horne had forgotten the argument in favour of concubinage which
occurs alike in the English verse and the Latin prose. Hallam
accuses Pope of having "done great injustice to Eloisa by putting
the sentiments of a coarse and abandoned woman into her mouth."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a>
But the licentious doctrines which Pope utters in her name are in the
original Latin, except that when she asserts that love is inconsistent
with marriage, she speaks of her individual case, and does not avowedly
lay down a general maxim. Nor can Pope be charged with
misrepresentation because the language in which he expresses her
sensual cravings is not always borrowed from her pretended confessions.
As he has not exaggerated the dominion of her appetite,
nor the plainness with which she avows it, he cannot be said to have
degraded the copy below the model by an occasional variation in
the forms of speech. In fact the increased fervour he has imparted
to her religious aspirations renders his portrait the more elevated of the
two. The censure to which he lies open is not for deviating from
his text but for following it too faithfully.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
"The Epistle of Heloisa," says Wordsworth, "may be considered
as a species of monodrama," and he classes it under the head of
dramatic poetry. The painter of an ideal countenance omits the
subordinate details which do not contribute to the special expression
he desires to convey. By isolating he intensifies it. The holy calm of
Raphael's Madonnas would be marred by the introduction of all those
minutiæ in the living face which are not concerned in the dominant
sentiment. A monodramatic poem which turns upon a single conflict
of feeling possesses a kindred advantage. The one absorbing struggle
has undivided sway, and there is nothing to distract attention from
the pervading emotion. This unity of purpose was present to Pope's
mind with absolute distinctness, and he has executed his conception
with wonderful force. The combat between Heloisa's earthly inclinations
and heavenly convictions, the impetuosity with which she
passes from one to the other, the tempest in her soul whichever mood
prevails, deep alternately calling to deep, are depicted with concentrated
energy, and continuous pathos. Her glowing thoughts are
vehement without exaggeration, and the natural outbursts are untainted
by spurious artifice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pope's Eloisa to Abelard is," says Mason, "such a <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>
that nothing of the kind can be relished after it. Yet it is not the
story itself, nor the sympathy it excites in us, as Dr. Johnson
would have us think, that constitutes the principal merit in that incomparable
poem. It is the happy use he has made of the monastic
gloom of the Paraclete, and of what I will call papistical machinery,
which gives it its capital charm, so that I am almost inclined to
wonder (if I could wonder at any of that writer's criticisms) that he
did not take notice of this beauty, as his own superstitious turn certainly
must have given him more than a sufficient relish for it."<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
The buildings and scenery, solemn and sombre, undoubtedly heighten
the effect. There is an impressive harmony between the over-cast
mind of Heloisa, and the objects around her, which deepens the sadness.
But the comment of Mason is unfounded. Johnson <i>did</i>
"notice" the "beauty" derived from the gloom of the convent,
while the assertion that this is the "principal merit" of the poem is
an extravagant subordination of the human interest, which is the main
subject of the Epistle, to the comparatively brief though exquisite
description of the local accompaniments. Mason disliked and dreaded
Johnson, and avenged himself when Johnson was dead, by feeble
expressions of contempt.</p>

<p>The Rape of the Lock and the Epistle to Eloisa stand alone in
Pope's works. He produced nothing else which resembled them.
They have the merit of being master-pieces in opposite styles. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
first is remarkable for its delicious fancy and sportive satire; the
second for its fervid passion and tender melancholy. Two poems of
such rare and such different excellence would alone entitle Pope to
his fame. Like most great authors he published not a little which is
mediocre, but he is to be estimated by the qualities in which he soared
above the herd, and not by the lower range of mind he possessed in
common with inferior men. The Rape of the Lock is a higher effort
of genius than the Epistle. Pope's adaptation of his aery, refulgent
sylphs to the ephemeral trivialities of fashionable life, the admirable
art with which he fitted his fairy machinery to the follies and common-places
of a giddy London day, the poetic grace which he threw
around his sarcastic narrative, and which unites with it as naturally
as does the rose with its thorny stem, are all unborrowed beauties,
and consummate in their kind. The story and sentiments of Heloisa
were prepared to his hand, and the power is limited to the strength
and sweetness of his language and versification, and to the vigour
with which he appropriated and expanded a single leading idea. His
imagination was not prolific, and his thoughts seldom sprung from
within. Sir William Napier said to Moore, "You are a poet by
force of will; Byron by force of nature," which Moore acknowledged
to be true. Pope, like Moore, was a poet because from his childhood
he had assiduously cultivated poetry. The bulk of his works
are either direct translations, or freer renderings under the name of
imitations, and putting aside the Rape of the Lock, and parts of his
satires, the materials of his original pieces, such as the Essay on
Criticism, and Essay on Man, are mostly taken from other authors.
The thoughts in the Epistle of Eloisa are not more his own than his
critical rules, and ethical philosophy, but the passionate emotions are
more poetical, and the execution more finished. Of Pope's better
qualities the chief appears to have been a certain tenderness of heart,
and this enabled him to enter into the feelings of Heloisa. He employed
all the resources of his choicest verse to perfect the picture,
and though the details he transferred from the letters deprived him
of the credit of invention, the supposed historic truth of the representation
increased the effect. The difference between legitimate
and worthless imitation could not be more forcibly illustrated than
by comparing the tame landscape, and affected love-babble of his
Pastorals with the local descriptions and impassioned strains in his
Epistle of Eloisa.</p>

<a name="THE_ARGUMENT"
 id="THE_ARGUMENT">THE ARGUMENT.</a></span></h2>


<p>Abelard and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth century.
They were two of the most distinguished persons of their age
in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for
their unfortunate passion. After a long course of calamities,
they retired each to a several convent, and consecrated the

this separation, that a letter of Abelard's to a friend, which
contained the history of his misfortune, fell into the hands of
Eloisa. This, awakening all her tenderness, occasioned those
celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly
extracted) which give so lively a picture of the struggles of
grace and nature, virtue and passion.</p>

<p>This is the first edition of Epistle I. of the Essay on Man, which was published
anonymously, and without any date on the title-page, Feb. 1733. It
was also printed in quarto and octavo. The octavo has not the prefatory

Man for one year was bought by Gilliver for 50<i>l</i>. an Epistle.</p>

<p>The rest of the title-page is the same as in the first edition. This second
edition has a table of Contents to the first three Epistles, which were originally
published without the table. The fourth Epistle had the table prefixed from
the outset. With the exception of the first Epistle, I am not aware that there
was a second edition of any part of the Essay on Man till the whole was incorporated
in the works of the poet. An octavo edition, published by <span class="smcap">Wilford</span>
in 1736, is called the seventh; but he may have counted in the three sizes of the
first edition, together with the editions which had appeared in Pope's works.</p>

<p>The title of the third and fourth Epistle is the same as that of the second.
At the end of the third Epistle is this notice: "N.B. The rest of the work

of the fourth Epistle about the middle of January, 1734. The last three
Epistles were printed like their precursor, in quarto and octavo, as well as
folio. The octavo edition of all four Epistles differs from the rest in having
the year on the title-page,&mdash;the first three, 1733, the fourth Epistle, 1734.</p>

<p>This is the first edition with Warburton's Commentary, and the last which
appeared during the life-time of Pope. The Essay on Criticism is in the same
volume, which was kept back for some months after it was printed, and was
not published till 1744.</p>
<hr />
<p>Warburton and Hurd have introduced a new kind of criticism, in
which they discover views and purposes the authors never had, and
they themselves never believed they had, but consider them as the
refinements of their own delicate conceptions, only taking hints from
these authors, to show how much higher they themselves would have
carried the same ideas. Warburton's discovering "the regularity"
of Pope's Essay on Criticism, and "the whole scheme" of his Essay
on Man, I happen to know to be mere absurd refinement in creating
conformities, and that from Pope himself, though he thought fit to
adopt them afterwards. By this method of overlooking the plain
and simple meaning which presents itself at first sight (as that of
good authors always does, only that there is no credit to be gained
in discovering what any one else could discover) it might clearly be
shown that Pope's Art of Criticism, is, indeed, an Essay on Man, and
his Essay on Man was really designed by the deep author for an Art
of Criticism. I know that these would not be more false than the
assertion and sophistry in proving "the regularity" of his Art of
Criticism, since he, when often speaking of it, before he so much as
knew Warburton, spoke of it always, as an "irregular collection of
thoughts thrown together as they offered themselves, as Horace's
Art of Poetry was, and written in imitation of that irregularity,"
which he even admired, and said was beautiful. As for his Essay
on Man, as I was witness to the whole conduct of it in writing, and
actually have his original MSS. for it from the first scratches of
the four books, to the several finished copies, all which, with the MS.
of his Essay on Criticism, and several of his other works, he gave
me himself for the pains I took in collating the whole with the
printed editions, at his request, on my having proposed to him the
"making an edition of his works in the manner of Boileau's,"&mdash;as
to this noblest of his works, I know that he never dreamed of the
scheme he afterwards adopted, perhaps for good reasons, for he had
taken terror about the clergy, and Warburton himself, at the general
alarm of its fatalism, and deistical tendency, of which however we
talked with him (my father and I) frequently at Twickenham, without
his appearing to understand it otherwise, or ever thinking to
alter those passages, which we suggested as what might seem the
most exceptionable.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
The Essay on Man was at first given, as Mr. Pope told me, to
Dr. Young, to Dr. Desaguliers,<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> to Lord Bolingbroke, to Lord Paget,<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
and in short to everybody but to him who was capable of writing it.
While several of his acquaintances read the Essay on Man as the
work of an unknown author, they fairly owned they did not understand
it,<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> but when the reputation of the poem became secured by
the knowledge of the writer, it soon grew so clear and intelligible,
that, on the appearance of the Comment on it, they told him they
wondered the editor should think a large and minute interpretation
necessary.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span></p>

<p>[In 1733] Pope published the first part of what he persuaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
himself to think a system of ethics, under the title of an Essay on
Man, which, if his letter to Swift of September 14, 1725, be rightly
explained by the commentator,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> had been eight years under his consideration,
and of which he seems to have desired the success with
great solicitude. He had now many open and doubtless many secret
enemies. The dunces were yet smarting with the war; and the
superiority which he publicly arrogated disposed the world to wish
his humiliation. All this he knew, and against all this he provided.
His own name, and that of his friend to whom the work is inscribed,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
were in the first editions carefully suppressed, and the poem, being
of a new kind, was ascribed to one or another, as favour determined
or conjecture wandered: it was given, says Warburton, to every man
except him only who could write it. Those who like only when they
like the author, and who are under the dominion of a name, condemned
it, and those admired it who are willing to scatter praise
at random, which while it is unappropriated excites no envy. Those
friends of Pope that were trusted with the secret went about lavishing
honours on the new-born poet, and hinting that Pope was never so
much in danger from any former rival. To those authors whom he
had personally offended, and to those whose opinion the world considered
as decisive, and whom he suspected of envy or malevolence,
he sent his Essay as a present before publication, that they might
defeat their own enmity by praises which they could not afterwards
decently retract.
<a name="With_these_precautions_in" id="With_these_precautions_in">
With these precautions, in</a> 1732[3] was published
the first part of the Essay on Man. There had been for some time a
report that Pope was busy upon a system of morality; but this
design was not discovered in the new poem, which had a form and a
title with which its readers were unacquainted. Its reception was
not uniform; some thought it a very imperfect piece, though not
without good lines. While the author was unknown, some, as will
always happen, favoured him as an adventurer, and some censured
him as an intruder, but all thought him above neglect: the sale increased,
and editions were multiplied. The second and third Epistles
were published, and Pope was, I believe, more and more suspected
of writing them. At last, in 1734, he avowed the fourth, and claimed
the honour of a moral poet.</p>

<p>In the conclusion it is sufficiently acknowledged that the doctrine
of the Essay on Man was received from Bolingbroke, who is said to
have ridiculed Pope, among those who enjoyed his confidence, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
having adopted and advanced principles of which he did not perceive
the consequence, and as blindly propagating opinions contrary to
his own. That those communications had been consolidated into a
scheme regularly drawn, and delivered to Pope, from whom it returned
only transformed from prose to verse, has been reported, but
hardly can be true.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> The Essay plainly appears the fabric of a poet:
what Bolingbroke supplied could be only the first principles; the
order, illustration, and embellishments must all be Pope's. These
principles it is not my business to clear from obscurity, dogmatism,
or falsehood; but they were not immediately examined: philosophy
and poetry have not often the same readers, and the Essay abounded
in splendid amplifications and sparkling sentences, which were read
and admired with no great attention to their ultimate purpose; its
flowers caught the eye, which did not see what the gay foliage concealed,
and for a time flourished in the sunshine of universal approbation.
So little was any evil tendency discovered, that, as innocence
is unsuspicious, many read it for a manual of piety.</p>

<p>Its reputation soon invited a translator. It was first turned into
French prose, and afterwards by Resnel into verse. Both translations
fell into the hands of Crousaz, who first, when he had the
version in prose, wrote a general censure, and afterwards reprinted
Resnel's version with particular remarks upon every paragraph.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
Crousaz was a professor of Switzerland, eminent for his treatise of
Logic, and his Examen de Pyrrhonisme, and, however little known
or regarded here, was no mean antagonist. His mind was one of
those in which philosophy and piety are happily united. He was
accustomed to argument and disquisition, and was perhaps grown
too desirous of detecting faults; but his intentions were always right,
his opinions were solid, and his religion pure. His incessant vigilance
for the promotion of piety disposed him to look with distrust
upon all metaphysical systems of theology, and all schemes of virtue

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and happiness purely rational; and therefore it was not long before
he was persuaded that the positions of Pope, as they terminated for
the most part in natural religion, were intended to draw mankind
away from revelation, and to represent the whole course of things as
a necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality; and it is undeniable
that, in many passages, a religious eye may easily discover
expressions not very favourable to morals or liberty.</p>

<p>About this time Warburton began to make his appearance in the
first ranks of learning. He was a man of vigorous faculties, a mind
fervid and vehement, supplied, by incessant and unlimited inquiry,
with wonderful extent and variety of knowledge, which yet had not
oppressed his imagination nor clouded his perspicacity. To every
work he brought a memory full fraught, together with a fancy fertile
of original combinations, and at once exerted the powers of the
scholar, the reasoner, and the wit. But his knowledge was too
multifarious to be always exact, and his pursuits too eager to be
always cautious. His abilities gave him a haughty confidence,
which he disdained to conceal or mollify; and his impatience of opposition
disposed him to treat his adversaries with such contemptuous
superiority as made his readers commonly his enemies, and excited
against the advocate the wishes of some who favoured the cause. He
seems to have adopted the Roman emperor's determination, "oderint
dum metuant;" he used no allurements of gentle language, but
wished to compel rather than persuade. His style is copious without
selection, and forcible without neatness; he took the words that presented
themselves; his diction is coarse and impure, and his sentences
are unmeasured. He had in the early part of his life pleased himself
with the notice of inferior wits, and corresponded with the
enemies of Pope. A letter was produced when he had perhaps himself
forgotten it, in which he tells Concanen, "Dryden, I observe, borrows
for want of leisure, and Pope for want of genius; Milton out of
pride, and Addison out of modesty." And when Theobald published
Shakespeare, in opposition to Pope, the best notes were supplied by
Warburton.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> But the time was now come when Warburton was to
change his opinion, and Pope was to find a defender in him who had
contributed so much to the exaltation of his rival. The arrogance
of Warburton excited against him every artifice of offence, and therefore
it may be supposed that his union with Pope was censured as
hypocritical inconstancy; but surely to think differently at different
times of poetical merit may be easily allowed. Such opinions are
often admitted and dismissed without nice examination. Who is
there that has not found reason for changing his opinion about questions
of greater importance? Warburton, whatever was his motive,

undertook, without solicitation, to rescue Pope from the talons of
Crousaz, by freeing him from the imputation of favouring fatality or
rejecting revelation; and from month to month continued a vindication
of the Essay on Man in the literary journal of that time, called
The Republic of Letters.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Pope, who probably began to doubt the
tendency of his own work, was glad that the positions, of which he
perceived himself not to know the full meaning, could by any mode
of interpretation be made to mean well. How much he was pleased
with his gratuitous defender the following letter evidently shows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">April 11, 1739.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just received from Mr. R[obinson]<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> two more of your letters.
It is in the greatest hurry imaginable that I write this; but I cannot help thanking
you in particular for your third letter, which is so extremely clear, short, and
full, that I think Mr. Crousaz ought never to have another answer, and deserved
not so good an one. I can only say you do him too much honour, and me too
much right, so odd as the expression seems; for you have made my system as
clear as I ought to have done, and could not. It is indeed the same system as
mine, but illustrated with a ray of your own, as they say our natural body is the
same still when it is glorified. I am sure I like it better than I did before, and
so will every man else. I know I meant just what you explain; but I did not
explain my own meaning so well as you. You understand me as well as I do
myself; but you express me better than I could express myself. Pray accept the
sincerest acknowledgments. I cannot but wish these letters were put together in
one book,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and intend, with your leave, to procure a translation of part, at least,
or of all of them into French; but I shall not proceed a step without your consent
and opinion, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>By this fond and eager acceptance of an exculpatory comment,
Pope testified that whatever might be the seeming or real import of
the principles which he had received from Bolingbroke, he had not
intentionally attacked religion; and Bolingbroke, if he meant to
make him, without his own consent, an instrument of mischief, found
him now engaged, with his eyes open, on the side of truth. It is
known that Bolingbroke concealed from Pope his real opinions. He
once discovered them to Mr. Hooke, who related them again to Pope,
and was told by him that he must have mistaken the meaning of
what he heard; and Bolingbroke, when Pope's uneasiness incited
him to desire an explanation, declared that Hooke had misunderstood
him. Bolingbroke hated Warburton, who had drawn his
pupil from him; and a little before Pope's death they had a dispute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
from which they parted with mutual aversion.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> From this time Pope
lived in the closest intimacy with his commentator, and amply
rewarded his kindness and his zeal; for he introduced him to Mr.
Murray, by whose interest he became preacher at Lincoln's Inn,
and to Mr. Allen, who gave him his niece and his estate, and by
consequence a bishopric. When he died, he left him the property of
his works, a legacy which may be reasonably estimated at four
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Pope's fondness for the Essay on Man appeared by his desire of its
propagation. Dobson, who had gained reputation by his version of
Prior's Solomon, was employed by him to translate it into Latin
verse, and was for that purpose some time at Twickenham; but he
left his work, whatever was the reason, unfinished,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and, by Benson's
invitation, undertook the longer task of Paradise Lost. Pope then
desired his friend<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> to find a scholar who should turn his Essay into
Latin prose, but no such performance has ever appeared.</p>

<p>The Essay on Man was a work of great labour and long consideration,
but certainly not the happiest of Pope's performances.
The subject is perhaps not very proper for poetry, and the poet was
not sufficiently master of his subject; metaphysical morality was
to him a new study, he was proud of his acquisitions, and, supposing
himself master of great secrets, was in haste to teach what he
had not learned. Thus he tells us, in the first epistle, that from
the nature of the Supreme Being may be deduced an order of beings
such as mankind, because infinite excellence can do only what
is best. He finds out that these beings must be "somewhere," and
that "all the question is whether man be in a wrong place." Surely
if, according to the poet's Leibnitzian reasoning, we may infer that
man ought to be, only because he is, we may allow that his place
is the right place because he has it. Supreme Wisdom is not less
infallible in disposing than in creating. But what is meant by
"somewhere," and "place," and "wrong place," it had been vain
to ask Pope, who probably had never asked himself.</p>

<p>Having exalted himself into the chair of wisdom, he tells us much
that every man knows, and much that he does not know himself:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
that we see but little, and that the order of the universe is beyond
our comprehension&mdash;an opinion not very uncommon; and that there
is a chain of subordinate beings "from infinite to nothing," of
which himself and his readers are equally ignorant. But he gives
us one comfort which, without his help, he supposes unattainable, in
the position "that though we are fools, yet God is wise."</p>

<p>This Essay affords an egregious instance of the predominance of
genius, the dazzling splendour of imagery, and the seductive powers
of eloquence. Never was penury of knowledge, and vulgarity of
sentiment, so happily disguised. The reader feels his mind full,
though he learns nothing, and when he meets it in its new array, no
longer knows the talk of his mother and his nurse. When these
wonder-working sounds sink into sense, and the doctrine of the Essay,
disrobed of its ornaments, is left to the powers of its naked excellence,
what shall we discover? That we are, in comparison with our Creator,
very weak and ignorant,&mdash;that we do not uphold the chain of existence&mdash;and
that we could not make one another with more skill than we
are made. We may learn yet more,&mdash;that the arts of human life were
copied from the instinctive operations of other animals,&mdash;that if the
world be made for man, it may be said that man was made for geese.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>
To these profound principles of natural knowledge are added some
moral instructions equally new,&mdash;that self interest, well understood,
will produce social concord&mdash;that men are mutual gainers by mutual
benefits&mdash;that evil is sometimes balanced by good&mdash;that human
advantages are unstable and fallacious, of uncertain duration and
doubtful effect&mdash;that our true honour is not to have a great part,
but to act it well&mdash;that virtue only is our own&mdash;and that happiness is
always in our power. Surely a man of no very comprehensive search
may venture to say that he has heard all this before; but it was
never till now recommended by such a blaze of embellishments,
or such sweetness of melody. The vigorous contraction of some
thoughts, the luxuriant amplification of others, the incidental illustrations,
and sometimes the dignity, sometimes the softness of the
verse, enchain philosophy, suspend criticism, and oppress judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
by overpowering pleasure. This is true of many paragraphs, yet if I
had undertaken to exemplify Pope's felicity of composition before a
rigid critic, I should not select the Essay on Man; for it contains
more lines unsuccessfully laboured, more harshness of diction, more
thoughts imperfectly expressed, more levity without elegance, and
more heaviness without strength, than will easily be found in all his
other works.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>Pope has not wandered into any useless digressions; has employed
no fictions, no tale or story, and has relied chiefly on the poetry of
his style for the purpose of interesting his readers. His style is
concise and figurative, forcible and elegant. He has many metaphors
and images, artfully interspersed in the driest passages, which stood
most in need of such ornaments. Nevertheless there are too many
lines, in this performance, plain and prosaic. If any beauty be
uncommonly transcendent and peculiar, it is brevity of diction,
which, in a few instances, and those perhaps pardonable, has occasioned
obscurity. It is hardly to be imagined how much sense, how
much thinking, how much observation on human life, is condensed
together in a small compass.</p>

<p>The late Lord Bathurst repeatedly assured me that he had read
the whole scheme of the Essay on Man, in the handwriting of
Bolingbroke, and drawn up in a series of propositions, which Pope
was to amplify, versify, and illustrate. It has been alleged that Pope
did not fully comprehend the drift of the system communicated to
him by Bolingbroke, but the remarkable words of his intimate
friend, Mr. Jonathan Richardson, a man of known integrity and
honour, clearly evince that he did. To the testimony of Richardson,
which is decisive, I will now add that Lord Lyttelton, with his
usual frankness and ingenuity, assured me that he had frequently
talked with Pope on the subject, whose opinions were at that time
conformable to his own, when he and his friends were too much
inclined to deism. Mr. Harte more than once assured me, that he
had seen the pressing letter Dr. Young wrote to Pope, urging him
to write something on the side of revelation, to which he alluded in
the first Night Thought:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
O! had he pressed his theme, pursued the track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which opens out of darkness into day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! had he mounted on his wing of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soared when I sink, and sung immortal man.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when Harte frequently made the same request, he used to
answer, "No, no! You have already done it," alluding to Harte's
Essay on Reason, which Harte thought a lame apology, and hardly
serious.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>The ground of the Essay on Man is philosophy, not poetry. The
poetry is only the colouring, if I may say so, and to the colouring

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the eye is chiefly attentive. We hardly think of the philosophy
whether it is good or bad; whether it is profound or specious;
whether it evinces deep thinking, or exhibits only in new and pompous
array the "babble of the nurse." Scarcely any one, till a controversy
was raised, thought of the doctrines, but a thousand must
have been warmed by the pictures, the addresses, the sublime interspersions
of description, and the nice and harmonious precision of
every word, and of almost every line. Whether, as a system of
philosophy, it inculcated fate or not, no one paused to inquire;<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
but every eye read a thousand times, and every lip, perhaps, repeated,
"Lo, the poor Indian," "The lamb thy riot," "Oh, happiness,"
and many other passages. All these illustrative and secondary
images are painted from the source of genuine poetry; from
nature, not from art. They therefore, independent of powers displayed
in the versification, raise the Essay on Man, considered in
the abstract, into genuine poetry, although the poetical part is subservient
to the philosophical.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, unfair as Johnson's criticism is, it is not
entirely destitute of truth. Many of Pope's conclusions in this
Essay, after a vast deal of fine verbiage and apparent argument, are
such as required very little proof,&mdash;"though man's a fool, yet God
is wise,"&mdash;and many other axioms equally true. But can we say
the whole exhibits only a train of tritenesses? "Materiam superabat
opus," it is acknowledged; and possibly, had it been more recondite,
it could not have been made the vehicle of so many acknowledged
beauties of expression, of imagery, and of poetic illustration. The
more it is read the more it will be relished, and the more will the
nice precision of every word, and the general beauty of its structure,
be acknowledged. Though the treasures of knowledge within be
not, perhaps, either very rich or rare, yet, to say it contains no
striking sentiments, no truths placed in a more advanced as well
as a more pleasing light, would be a manifest and palpable injustice.
After all, poetry is not a good vehicle for philosophy, but as a philosophical
poem, take it altogether, it would not be very easy, with
the exception of Lucretius, to find its equal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>Bolingbroke amused his unwelcome leisure during his exile in
studying the infidel philosophy which prevailed in France. The
vices of his nature are conspicuous in his metaphysical writings.
He pretends to abstruse learning, and it is apparent that he has
done little more than pick up fragments of systems at second-hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
He assumes a commanding superiority over his illustrious predecessors,
of whom he commonly speaks with insane contempt, and he
has not enunciated a single new doctrine, or put one old doctrine in
a novel light. He affects to soar above sinister motives and prejudices,
and writes with the rancour of a bitter partisan who is the
creature of passion. He denounces the dishonesty of christian
apologists, and perpetually misrepresents them; he inveighs against
their inconsistencies, and falls himself into repeated contradictions.
The characteristics of the old political debater are preserved intact
in the philosopher. He kept his parliamentary style with the rest,&mdash;the
diffuse rhetoric, the constant repetitions, the lengthy preparation
for ideas not worth the prelude. The mind droops over the
pretentious verbiage, and the magnificent promise of results which
never come. "Who," said Burke, "now reads Bolingbroke? Who
ever read him through?"<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> The cheat once detected, no one wearies
himself in the pursuit of a flying phantom.</p>

<p>In 1723 Bolingbroke was permitted to return to England. After
a short visit he went back to France, and did not settle here till
October, 1724. He soon contracted an intimacy with Pope, and
imparted to him his irreligious metaphysics. Bolingbroke's knowledge
of philosophy, though not profound, was respectable, and with
the uninformed he could disguise his want of depth by a flux of
specious language. Pope, ignorant of mental, moral, and theological
science, mistook his oracular arrogance for real supremacy, his discordant
sophisms for demonstrations, his hackneyed plagiarisms for
originality. He thought him by much the greatest man he had ever
known, and of all his titles to fame the chief he imagined was as a
"writer and philosopher."<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> He ranked him among the metaphysical
luminaries of the world, and never suspected that the moment his
disquisitions were communicated to the public they would be tossed
aside with disdain, and consigned to lasting neglect.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke persuaded Pope to versify portions of the philosophy
he admired so extravagantly.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> A large scheme was drawn up, the
outline of which Pope repeated to Spence. "The first book, you
know, of my ethic work is on the Nature of Man. The second
would have been on knowledge and its limits. Here would have
come in an essay on education, part of which I have inserted in the
Dunciad. The third was to have treated of government, both ecclesiastical
and civil. The fourth would have been on morality in eight
or nine of the most concerning branches of it, four of which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
have been the two extremes to each of the cardinal virtues."<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> These
four cardinal virtues,&mdash;justice, temperance, prudence, and fortitude&mdash;would
alone have required twelve epistles, since every virtue was
to be treated on the Aristotelian plan, and divided into rational
medium, deficiency, and excess. The cardinal virtues were either
to be again subdivided, or else supplemented by subordinate virtues,
and all were to be presented under the triple form. "Each class,"
said Pope, speaking of the "eight or nine most concerning branches"
of morality, "may take up three epistles: one, for instance, against
Avarice; another against Prodigality: and the third on the moderate
use of Riches, and so of the rest."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> A short trial convinced Pope
that the scheme was too vast for a slow composer. When the first
book, which forms the Essay on Man, was completed, he told Spence
that "he had drawn in the plan much narrower than it was at first,"
and he attached to some copies of the Essay, which he circulated
among his particular friends, a table of this  diminished frame-work.</p>

</p>

<p>The cardinal virtues, with nearly all "the most concerning branches
of morality," were omitted from the abbreviated plan, which was
still too large for Pope's patience, and he left much of the work
unexecuted.</p>

<p>He commenced with some of the topics enumerated in the second
book of his "index." "Bid Pope talk to you of the work he is about,"
wrote Bolingbroke to Swift, Nov. 19, 1729. "It is a fine one, and
will be, in his hands, an original. His sole complaint is that he
finds it too easy in the execution. This flatters his laziness. It
flatters my judgment who always thought that, universal as his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
talents are, this is eminently and peculiarly his above all the writers
I know, living or dead. I do not except Horace." "The work,"
adds Pope, "which Lord Bolingbroke speaks of with such abundant
partiality is a system of ethics in the Horatian way." Bolingbroke's
comparison of the work to Horace, and Pope's phrase "the Horatian
way," show that they spoke of the Moral Essays, which, with the
Essay on Man, were at first included under the general title of Ethic
Epistles. The resemblance to Horace would not apply to the Essay
on Man in substance or style,&mdash;not in style, for Pope says himself
that the Essay was modelled on "the grave march of Lucretius" in
contradistinction to the familiar "gaieties of Horace,"<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>; not in substance,
for Horace did not write a philosophical poem on natural
religion, nor could he have been placed by Bolingbroke at the head
of a class of philosophical poets to which he in no way belonged.
Neither could Bolingbroke have said of Pope that "the talent
eminently and peculiarly his, above all writers living or dead," was
the power of sounding the depths of philosophy. The praise was
intended for the satiric sketches of men and manners which make up
the Moral Essays. These are truly in the "Horatian way," and in
a vein characteristic of the bent of Pope's mind.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke furnished little or nothing to the Horatian epistles.
His services commenced with the Essay on Man. Pope was revolving
this part of the scheme in May, 1730, when he said to
Spence, "The first epistle is to be to the whole work what a scale is
to a book of maps; and in this, I reckon, lies my greatest difficulty:
not only in settling and ranging the parts of it aright, but in
making them agreeable enough to be read with pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> A few
months later Bolingbroke writes to Lord Bathurst, Oct. 8, 1730,
that he and Pope "are at present deep in metaphysics." The
matter intended for the first epistle was expanded into four epistles
as the work proceeded, and in August, 1731, Bolingbroke announced
to Swift that three of them were completed, and that the fourth was
in hand. Eighteen months more elapsed before any portion of the
poem was published; and Pope doubtless spent the interval in
repeated revisions. It was not his habit to go straight forward in
regular order, and leave no gaps or flaws as he went along. When
he told Caryll in December, 1730, that he was "writing on life and
manners, not exclusive of religious regards," he adds, "I have many
fragments which I am beginning to put together, but nothing
perfect or finished, nor in any condition to be shown, except to a
friend at a fire-side." This system of composing disjointed fragments,
and methodising them afterwards, was unfavourable to continuity
and comprehension of thought, and did not help to diminish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the want of connection in his arguments, and of consistency in his
opinions.</p>

<p>The project of the Essay on Man was kept a secret from all but
a few of Pope's friends. To others he only spoke of his ethic
epistles in the "Horatian way." Caryll, on hearing from him that
he had taken to religion and morals, recommended Pascal's
Thoughts, and Pope answered, Feb. 6, 1731, "I have been
<a name="Beforehand" id="Beforehand">beforehand</a>
with you in it, but he will be of little use to my design, which
is rather to ridicule ill men than to preach to them. I fear our
age is past all other correction." The Essay on Man was then in
full progress, and Pope sent a false report that the style and tenor
of the work might not betray him when it was published. The first
epistle appeared anonymously in February, 1733, and to divert
suspicion, the poet put forth in January, with his name, his Epistle
on the Use of Riches, and a week or two afterwards one of his
Imitations of Horace. He had a subtler contrivance for misleading
the public. He made "lane" rhyme to "name" in his second
epistle, and told Harte the bad rhyme was a disguise to escape detection.
"Harte remembered," says Warton, "to have often heard
it urged in enquiries about the author, whilst he was unknown,
that it was impossible it could be Pope's on account of this very
passage."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Along with "lane" and "name," the first and second
epistles contained the rhymes which follow: "here, refer&mdash;pierce,
universe,&mdash;above, Jove&mdash;plain, man&mdash;fault, ought&mdash;food, blood&mdash;home,
come&mdash;abodes, gods&mdash;appears, bears&mdash;alone, none&mdash;race, grass&mdash;flood,
wood&mdash;want, elephant&mdash;join, line&mdash;alone, one&mdash;mourns,
burns&mdash;sphere, bear&mdash;rest, beast&mdash;sphere, fair&mdash;boast, frost&mdash;road,
God&mdash;preferred, guard&mdash;tossed, coast&mdash;joined, mind&mdash;caprice, vice."
There must have been some strange peculiarity in the ears of a
generation which could be revolted by "lane" and "name," and
welcome such rhymes as these. The anecdote cannot be correct. A
liberal admixture of faulty rhymes is a common characteristic of
Pope, and the disguise would have been greater if all the rhymes
had been good.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Johnson has told Pope's motive for publishing the Essay anonymously,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and the man&oelig;uvres he practised to secure commendation.
He had previously, when speaking to Swift of the Essay, professed
his usual indifference to praise. "I agree with you," he said,
Dec. 1, 1731, "in my contempt of most popularity, fame, &amp;c.
Even as a writer I am cool in it, and whenever you see what I am
now writing, you will be convinced I would please but a few, and, if I
could, make mankind less admirers and greater reasoners." After
the little plot had been played out, he still kept up the false pretence
in a letter to Duncombe, Oct. 20, 1734. "Truly, I had not the
least thought of stealing applause by suppressing my name to that
Essay. I wanted only to hear truth, and was more afraid of my
partial friends than enemies."<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> He lifted up the mask with Swift,
and avowed that his object was to get his philosophy approved. "The
design of concealing myself was good," he said, Sept. 15, 1734, "and
had its full effect; I was thought a divine, a philosopher, and what
not, and my doctrine had a sanction I could not have given to it."
He knew that friend and foe were aware that philosophy and divinity
were not his strength, and he wished to obtain a fictitious authority
for his work. He said to Caryll, March 8, 1733, "It is attributed,
I think with reason, to a divine," and the poet had probably circulated
the report he affected to believe. "I perceive the divines
have no objection to it," he wrote again on March 20, "though now
it is agreed not to be written by one,&mdash;Dr. Croxall, Dr. Secker, and
some others having solemnly denied it." The first reports decided the
popular judgment. The orthodoxy of the poem was taken upon
trust, and when Pope owned the work in 1734, no one cared to
commence a fresh inquisition.</p>

<p>An infidel who hated divines and divinity with all his heart, had
dictated the doctrines of the Essay on Man. "He mentioned then,
and at several other times," says Spence, in his record of Pope's conversation
during the years 1734-36, "how much, or rather how
wholly he was obliged to Lord Bolingbroke for the thoughts and
reasonings in his moral work; and once in particular said, that beside
their frequent talking over that subject together, he had received,
I think, seven or eight sheets from Lord Bolingbroke in relation to
it (as I apprehended by way of letters), both to direct the plan in
general, and to supply the matter for the particular epistles."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Pope
frankly informed the world, in the Essay itself, that he echoed the
lessons of Bolingbroke, who was his "guide and philosopher,"&mdash;the
"master of the poet and the song." The prose sketch of the
"master" was seen by Lord Bathurst at the time, and he testified
to Warton and Blair from personal knowledge, that Pope versified
the arguments set down for him by Bolingbroke.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>

Warburton reversed the parts. The "seven or eight sheets,"
which contained Bolingbroke's prose draught of the Essay on Man,
have not been preserved in their original form, and he did not reduce
his published philosophy to writing till after the poem was commenced.
"If," said Warburton, in allusion to the latter circumstance,
"you will take his lordship's word, or, indeed, attend to his argument,
you will find that Pope was so far from putting his prose into verse
that he has put Pope's verse into prose."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> But when Bolingbroke
mentioned that the Essay on Man was begun before his published
disquisitions were committed to paper, he added that they were
"nothing more than repetitions of conversations" with Pope.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> This
statement Warburton was dishonest enough to suppress, and deliberately
turned a half truth into a falsehood. The ungarbled expressions
of Bolingbroke confirm the assurances of Pope and Bathurst,
that he was the principal author of the philosophy in the Essay on
Man. Warburton could not keep to his misrepresentation. When
it was convenient for his purpose he changed his story, and Pope
became "a pupil who had to be reasoned out of Bolingbroke's hands,"&mdash;a
dupe who adopted Bolingbroke's insidious doctrines without perceiving
the infidelity, and who had to thank his deliverer that "the
poem was put on the side of religion."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Mallet told General Grimouard that Pope, Bolingbroke, and
their friends, who frequented her house, were "a society of pure
deists."<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> Bolingbroke was more of an infidel than Pope, for though
he admitted that a future state could not be disproved, he laboured
passionately to discredit the arguments in its favour. Pope held to
the immortality of the soul. "He was a deist," says Lord Chesterfield,
"believing in a future state; this he has often owned himself to
me."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> He frequently avowed his deism to Lyttelton, and acquiesced
in the deistical interpretations which the Richardsons put on the
Essay on Man. Revelation he rejected entirely. Lord Chesterfield
relates that he once saw a bible on his table, and adds, "As I knew
his way of thinking upon that book, I asked him jocosely if he was
going to write an answer to it?" The evidence that he had renounced
Christianity comes to us from various independent sources,
and some of the witnesses are above the suspicion of misunderstanding
or misrepresenting him.</p>

<p>One of the articles of Bolingbroke's deistical creed is said by Warburton
to have been concealed from Pope. "A few days before his
death," says Warburton, in the statement he drew up for Ruffhead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
"he would be carried to London to dine with Mr. Murray in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, whom he loved with the fondness of a father. He was
solicitous that Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Warburton should be of
the party. Some time before Mr. Warburton being with Mr. Pope
at Twickenham, Mr. Hooke came in, and told us he had supped the
night before at Battersea with Lord Bolingbroke, when his lordship
in conversation advanced the strangest notions concerning the moral
attributes of the Deity, which amounted to an express denial of them.
This account gave Mr. Pope much uneasiness, and he told Mr. Hooke
with much peevish heat that he was sure he was mistaken. The
other replied as warmly that he thought he had sense enough not
to mistake a man who spoke plainly, and in a language he understood.
Here the matter dropped. But Mr. Pope was not easy till
he had seen Lord Bolingbroke, and told him what Mr. Hooke said of
a late conversation. Lord Bolingbroke assured him that Mr. Hooke
misunderstood him. This assurance Mr. Pope with great pleasure
acquainted Mr. Warburton with the next time he saw him. But
Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Pope were both so full of this matter that
at this dinner at Mr. Murray's, the conversation, amongst other
things, naturally turned on this subject, when, from a very suspicious
remark of his lordship, Mr. Warburton took occasion to speak
of the clearness of our notions concerning the moral attributes. This
occasioned some debate, which ended in some warmth on his lordship's
side. This anecdote is not improper to be told in vindication
of Mr. Pope's religious sentiments, and the reflections on Mr. Warburton,
as if he had not attacked his lordship's impiety till after his
death."<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Warburton had previously told the story in his View of
Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy, and there he related that Bolingbroke
"denied God's moral attributes as they are commonly understood."<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
In the narrative he wrote for Ruffhead, Warburton reports
Hooke to have said, that Bolingbroke's "notions concerning the
moral attributes amounted to an express denial of them."<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> The
first statement Bolingbroke would have allowed to be correct; the
second he would have repudiated. The two versions are treated by
Warburton as one, and his charge against Bolingbroke, and his
"vindication of Mr. Pope's religious sentiments," are based upon
this presumed identity of propositions which were quite distinct to
Pope and Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke's views on the moral attributes of the Deity were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
result of his mania to get rid of the arguments for a future state.
Virtue is frequently oppressed and suffering in this world, and vice
prosperous; the wicked defraud, supplant, and persecute the upright;
and in manifold ways the felicities of life are not proportioned to the
behaviour of men. A righteous Deity, we may be sure, would not
ordain a constitution of things in which the good should repeatedly
fare worse than the bad, often in consequence of their persistence in
goodness, and then perish unrewarded in the midst of their self-denial.
The inference is plain that they will be finally compensated
in a kingdom to come. The struggle between sin and rectitude in
good men continues all their days, and when the battle has been
fought out, and the victory won, they are removed from the world.
It is incredible that a benevolent ruler should set us to maintain a
painful conflict with evil, and when we are disciplined to holiness
should consign us to annihilation. The hope that well-doing will
not go unrewarded, the apprehension that wickedness will not go
unpunished, are sentiments engrained in the heart of man, and we
may be confident that the source of all truth would not direct us to
govern our conduct by false anticipations. The supposition that there
is no future life is therefore inconsistent with the moral attributes of
God, and to avoid this deduction Bolingbroke took up the theory of one
of the worst class of deists, and contended that the moral attributes of
the Creator were not the same as in our ideas, and could not be
judged by our notions. He said he "ascribed all conceivable perfections
to God," and that he was as "far from denying his justice
and goodness as his wisdom and power," but insisted that his justice
and goodness differed from ours in kind as well as in degree.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
Wherever this hypothesis was brought in, the epithets "just and
good" either ceased to have any meaning for us, or they meant
exactly the reverse of "just and good." The object of the theory
was, indeed, to set up the maxim that conduct which would be
thought immoral among men might be the morality of God. Bolingbroke's
philosophic vision was limited to a single point at a time.
He abounds in astounding contradictions from his inability to keep
his most emphatic principles before his mind, and he might be
answered, without a word of comment, by ranging in parallel columns
the passages of his writings which are mutually destructive. His
hypothesis on the moral attributes of the Deity shared the usual fate
of his dogmas. He denounced the doctrine of predestination, and
called it "blasphemous," "impious," "devilish," because it was
"scandalously repugnant to our ideas of God's moral perfections,"
and supposed "a God such as no one could acknowledge."<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> The
moment he had to deal with an opinion he disliked, he thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
impious to imagine that the morality of God was not in conformity
with our ideas, and he loudly appealed to the immutability of those
innate moral convictions which alike defy the corrupt morality of
libertines who labour to justify evil, and the artificial morality of
metaphysicians who strive to prop up fanciful systems.</p>

<p>Warburton might fairly argue, that the theory which maintained
that the morality of the Deity was radically different in kind from
the moral conceptions of men, "amounted to an express denial of
God's moral attributes." He was not entitled to charge upon Bolingbroke
an inference he had vehemently disclaimed in his writings, and
which was so far from seeming necessary to all pious thinkers that
some distinguished christian divines had held the obnoxious hypothesis.
No two of them might have been of a mind in the application
of a principle the limits of which they could none of them
pretend to define, but they would all have concurred with Bolingbroke
that to deny the moral attributes of God, and to assert that
they were not the same as in our ideas, were distinct propositions.
The false turn which Warburton gave to his story is clear from the
sequel of his narrative. Pope brought him and Bolingbroke together.
The philosopher and his pupil, full of Hooke's accusation, introduced
the subject of their own accord. Bolingbroke advanced opinions on
the moral attributes which Warburton combated, and the debate
ended, as it began, in a total disagreement. The views which
Bolingbroke volunteered could not, for shame, be those which he had
just disclaimed to Pope, and they were notwithstanding quite unorthodox
in the estimation of Warburton. The case is simple.
Bolingbroke protested to Pope, what he had protested all along, that
he did not deny the moral attributes of God, and he maintained
against Warburton in Pope's presence, what he had all along avowed,
that they were not the same as in our ideas.</p>

<p>There is more, and conclusive evidence, that Bolingbroke had not
concealed his hypothesis from Pope. The incidents narrated by
Warburton occurred a few days before the poet's death. The philosophical
papers of Bolingbroke were "all communicated to him in
scraps as they were occasionally written,"<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> and the whole must
already have passed through his hands. In these disquisitions
Bolingbroke enforced his view of the divine attributes with tedious
diffuseness, incessant reiteration, and unmeasured warmth. No
opinion is brought out into stronger relief. A glance at the manuscript
must have revealed the hypothesis to Pope, and the Essay on
Man proves that he had actually adopted it. All who believed that
justice, goodness, and truth were immutable, thought that our
primary duty was to contemplate them in the Deity, and endeavour
to imitate his perfections. Pope followed Bolingbroke in rejecting

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the idea. Man, he said, could "just find a God" and nothing
more; consequently man was to be the only study of man.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Master
and pupil agreed that every perfection was to be ascribed to God,
and that he was to be loved, worshipped, and obeyed. But the
pupil, like the master, held that "God did not show his own nature
in his laws, because though they proceed from the divine intelligence
they are adapted to the human,"<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> and the last line of the Essay on
Man, the emphatic summary of a leading article in Pope's creed, is
that "all our knowledge is ourselves to know."</p>

<p>In a subsequent passage Warburton extended his assertion, and
alleged that Bolingbroke concealed the whole purpose of his theology
from Pope. "The poet," says Warburton, "directs his argument
against atheists and libertines in support of religion; the philosopher
against divines in support of naturalism. But his lordship thought
fit to keep this a secret from his friend as well as from the public."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>
The poet and the philosopher were both deists. The philosopher,
Warburton tells us, communicated his principles to associates "who
gave him to understand how much they detested them."<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> The
poet professed deism before Chesterfield, Lyttelton, the Richardsons
and the Mallets. Yet Warburton would have us believe that
Bolingbroke disclosed his infidelity to unsympathising friends, and
kept it a secret from his chief philosophical intimate, who frankly
avowed his own deism in the Bolingbroke circle. The statement,
incredible in itself, is opposed to the positive testimony of Bolingbroke
when he says that all his written opinions were only the
record of his conversations with Pope, and is even contradicted by
the unconscious testimony of Warburton. He tells us that when
Pope took refuge under his shield the circumstance which most
exasperated Bolingbroke was that "he saw a great number of lines
appear which, out of complaisance, had been struck out of the MS.,
and which, at the commentator's request, being now restored to their
places, no longer left the religious sentiments of the poet equivocal."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
The restored lines which modified any "religious sentiment" were
barely half a dozen, and were confined to the single tenet of a future
state. When Pope allowed his belief in a future state to seem
"equivocal, out of complaisance" to his "guide," the infidelity of
Bolingbroke could not have been unknown to him.</p>

<p>Still the plea of Warburton remains, that Bolingbroke was for
deism and Pope for Christianity. Bolingbroke, says Warburton,
argued for natural religion in opposition to revealed; Pope for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
revealed religion as a necessary supplement to natural. Warburton
refuted his own position in the attempt to establish it. He appealed
to three passages in the Essay on Man. The first, which he calls the
chief, is Epist. ii. ver. 149-160, where Pope terms "reason a weak
queen," which obeys the ruling passion. "The poet," says Warburton,
"leaves reason unrelieved. What is this but an intimation
that we ought to seek for a cure in that religion, which only dares
profess to give it?"<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> The poet, on the contrary, immediately proceeds
to show how reason can "rectify" the ruling passion, and finally
concludes, ver. 197, that "reason the bias turns to good from ill."
He insists that there is not a virtue under heaven which "pride" or
"shame," rectified by reason, will not produce, ver. 193, and he
informs us, ver. 183, that they are the "surest virtues" known
to man. The second passage is Epist. iii. ver. 287, where, "speaking,"
says Warburton, "of the great restorers of the religion of
nature, the poet intimates that they could only draw God's shadow,
not his image:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Relumed her ancient light, not kindled new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not God's image, yet his shadow drew:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as reverencing that truth which telleth us this discovery was reserved
for the 'glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God.'"<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
Pope was careful to show in his poem that his meaning was the
reverse of what Warburton pretends. He conceives that God's
image was hidden from our view, and that man, not God, was our
proper study:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Know then thyself, presume not God to scan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proper study of mankind is man.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He did not believe that the religion of nature, in this particular, was
under any disadvantage, for he said, Epist. iii. ver. 148, that "the
state of nature was the reign of God," and to "relume the ancient
light" was, to his apprehension, the perfection of theology. The third
passage is Epist. iv. 341-344, where Pope says, that "hope
lengthened on to faith pours the bliss that fills up all the mind."
"But natural religion," says Warburton, "never lengthened hope
on to faith, nor did any religion, but the christian, ever conceive that
faith could fill the mind with happiness."<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Pope was of a different
opinion. Hope and faith, according to his creed, and that of many
deists, were part of the religion of nature.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> He could not think
otherwise when he "was a deist believing in a future state," and he
was so far from supposing that the christian's faith had any superiority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
over the deist's in filling the mind with bliss, that all who
"fought for modes of faith" were, in his estimation, "graceless
zealots."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> The searching acumen of Warburton, who never had his
equal in forcing false meanings from his text, could not discover
another allusion to christianity. His interpretations, strained at
best, are directly opposed to the context, and this failure to detect one
word which could honestly support his construction, leaves no doubt
that the Essay on Man was intended for a system of natural religion
to the exclusion of revealed.</p>

<p>The poet and his "guide" agreed in repudiating christianity.
They differed on the question of a future state, but Pope, while
rejecting Bolingbroke's conclusion, adopted his premises. "The
fourth epistle he is now intent upon," wrote Bolingbroke to Swift,
Aug. 2, 1731. "It is a noble subject. He pleads the cause of God,
I use Seneca's expression, against that famous charge which atheists
in all ages have brought, the supposed unequal dispensations of
Providence,&mdash;a charge which I cannot heartily forgive your divines
for admitting. You admit it, indeed, for an extreme good purpose,
and you build on this admission the necessity of a future state of
rewards and punishments. But what if you should find that this
future state will not account, in opposition to the atheist, for God's
justice in the present state which you give up? Would it not have
been better to defend God's justice in this world, against these daring
men, by irrefragable reasons, and to have rested the proof of the
other point on revelation? You will not understand by what I have
said that Pope will go so deep into the argument, or carry it so far
as I have hinted." To rest the proof of a future state on revelation,
was in Bolingbroke's estimation to build upon a fable. To abandon
the proof from reason was therefore with him to relinquish the
doctrine. Pope, who had accepted the theory that the justice of
God could not be judged by our ideas, embraced the second and
superfluous paradox, that the dispensations of God in this world were
never unequal. On either ground, said Bolingbroke, the justice of
God did not require a future state. The poet had rejected the
witness of revelation to the immortality of the soul, and, under the
pretext of "pleading the cause of God against atheists," his "guide"
had persuaded him to give up the popular proof from reason. He
stopped short of the inference that reason did not countenance a
future state, or, in Bolingbroke's phrase, "he did not go so deep
into the argument." His "guide" laughed at his inconsequence,
and "could not," says Warburton, "forbear making the poet, then
alive and at his devotion, the frequent topic of his ridicule amongst
their common acquaintance as a man who understood nothing of his
own principles, nor saw to what they naturally tended."<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Bolingbroke was not entitled to ridicule Pope. The docile pupil
was not more blind to the reach of the principles instilled into
him than was the arrogant master who imposed them. He said
the notion that a future world could be essential to vindicate this
world was not only needless, but blasphemous. He was never
weary of railing at the impiety of the doctrine, and he pretended
that the divines who held it "renounced God as much as the rankest
of the atheistical tribe."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> He did not see that the alleged impiety
was the identical principle he adopted for the foundation of his philosophy,
when, admitting the evils on our globe, he contended that
they were linked to a larger scheme which would explain and justify
them. "The universe," he said, "is an immense aggregate of
systems. Atheists and divines cannot, or will not conceive, that the
seeming imperfection of the parts is necessary to the real perfection
of the whole."<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> He wronged the divines. They could, and did
"conceive that the fitness of the particular portions of a scheme
must depend upon their relation to the entire plan," and it was precisely
because they argued that the justice of God in this world
would be incomprehensible unless we extended our view to the world
to come, that Bolingbroke charged them with accusing the Deity of
injustice, and ranked them with atheists. The incapacity to understand
his own principles could not be carried further.</p>

<p>Pope did not intend to proclaim openly to the world the deism he
disclosed to his sceptical companions. "I know," wrote Bolingbroke,
"your precaution enough to know that you will screen
yourself against any direct charge of heterodoxy."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> His plan
was to put forth a scheme of natural religion without repudiating
christianity in terms, that he might be able to give his poem any
interpretation he pleased. He soon manifested his double design.
Before he avowed himself the author of the Essay on Man, he was
anxious that Caryll should be convinced of its orthodoxy. "Out of
complaisance" to Bolingbroke, he had left undecided the question of
the immortality of the soul:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
<i>If</i> to be perfect in a certain state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What matter, here or there, or soon or late?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He feared that this dubious language would be distasteful to Caryll,
and thus wrote to him on March 8, 1733. "The town is now very
full of a new poem, entitled an Essay on Man. It has merit, in my
opinion, but not so much as they give it. At least, it is incorrect, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
has some inaccuracies in the expressions,&mdash;one or two of an unhappy
kind, for they may cause the author's sense to be turned, contrary to
what I think his intention, a little unorthodoxically. Nothing is so
plain, as that he quits his proper subject, this present world, to assert
his belief of a future state, and, yet there is an <i>if</i> instead of a <i>since</i>
that would overthrow his meaning."<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> Pope several times reprinted
the poem with corrections, but never altered the word which misrepresented
his creed on the question whether death was annihilation or
immortality. He had a public version, which he adopted "out of
complaisance to Bolingbroke," overborne by his showy rhetoric and
imperious dogmatism, and a private version for his pious friend, to
whom he professed that his conditional language was an "inaccuracy
of expression which overthrew his meaning."</p>

<p>Pope's private profession of his belief in a future state was his real
conviction. He proceeded to belie his true opinions, by standing up
for the christianity of the Essay on Man. "The author," he says,
"uses the words 'God the soul of the world,' which, at the first
glance, may be taken for heathenism, while his whole paragraph
proves him quite christian in his system, from man up to seraphim."
Caryll was not convinced, and on October 23 Pope wrote to reassure
him. "I believe the author of the Essay on Man will end his poem
in such a manner as will satisfy your scruple. I think it impossible
for him, with any congruity to his confined and strictly philosophical
subject, to mention our Saviour directly; but he may magnify the
christian doctrine as the perfection of all moral; nay, and even, I
fancy, quote the very words of the Gospel precept, that includes all
the law and the precepts, <i>Thou shalt love God above all things</i>, &amp;c.,
and I conclude that will remove all possible occasion of scandal."
He wrote again to the same effect on January 1, 1734:&mdash;"To the
best of my judgment the author shows himself a christian at last in
the assertion, that all earthly happiness, as well as future felicity,
depends upon the doctrine of the Gospel,&mdash;love of God and man,&mdash;and
that the whole aim of our being is to attain happiness here and
hereafter by the practice of universal charity to man, and entire
resignation to God. More particular than this he could not be with
any regard to the subject, or manner in which he treated it." From
the next letter of the poet, on February 28, it would appear that the
"scruple" of Caryll was removed, influenced, perhaps, by the discovery
that the work was Pope's own production. "Your candid
opinion," says Pope, "not only on the Essay on Man, but its author,
pleases me truly. I think verily he is as honest, and as religious a
man as myself, and one that will never forfeit justly your kind character
of him. It is not directly owned, and I do assure you never
was whilst you were kept in ignorance of it."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> The explanations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
which satisfied Caryll should have increased his suspicions, for
Pope's language was plainly evasive. He rested the whole of his
christianity on the doctrines which were held by a large class of
deists. He neither avowed his faith in Christ, nor declared his
belief that the Gospels were a revelation from God. He had drawn
upon Wollaston's admirable work, The Religion of Nature Delineated,
and there he had seen how inevitably a christian, who
presses the arguments for natural religion, must sometimes refer to
the fuller evidence of Scripture, and adopt a tone which would make
it impossible that he could be mistaken for a deist. With this model
under his eyes, and with the professed desire "to show himself a
christian," and "remove all possible occasion of scandal," the ingenuity
of the poet was insufficient to devise a single phrase which
the majority of English deists would not have subscribed. Even the
bare term "christian," which he flourished before Caryll, did not
appear in the poem. He kept the word for the ear of the simple
country squire, and imposed upon him by the transparent artifice of
privately calling the doctrines of deism christianity. The "address,"
which he told Spence he had "written to our Saviour," would not
have contributed to vindicate his orthodoxy, as we may judge from
his statement, that it was "imitated from Lucretius's compliment to
Epicurus, and omitted by the advice of Berkeley."<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> The application
to our Lord of the compliment to Epicurus must have been shocking
to Berkeley, and could never have entered into the mind of any one
who believed that Jesus Christ was "God manifest in the flesh."</p>

<p>A few persons, not in the secret of Pope's deism, had the discernment
to share the first impressions of Caryll. The celebrated David
Hartley is said, by his son, to have "regarded the Essay on Man as
tending to insinuate that the Divine revelation of the christian religion
was superfluous," and to substitute for it "the plagiarisms of
modern ethics from christian doctrines." But readers in general
were more attentive to the poetry than the philosophy, and did not
detect the lurking heresies of the poem till Crousaz published his
<i>Examen de l'Essai de Mr. Pope</i> in 1737, which he enforced by his
more elaborate <i>Commentaire</i> in the following year. "Mr. Pope's
name, and not his own, spread them," says Dr. Middleton, "into
everybody's hands."<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> Hitherto the poet had not been far wrong in
his calculation, that his deism would pass unsuspected, because not
directly professed, and the tenets he taught explicitly he believed to
be so unanswerable, that, in a suppressed passage of the fourth
Epistle, he raised a shout of triumph over the "scattered fools who
would fly trembling from the heels" of his Pegasus. The comments
of Crousaz, often founded upon mistranslations and misconceptions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
laid bare sufficient sophistries, inconsistencies, and irreligion, to open
the eyes of the public. Pope's confidence immediately changed to
fright. "He took terror," says Richardson, "about the clergy, and
Warburton himself, at the general alarm of its fatalism and deistical
tendency." The poet had a dread of incurring the obloquy of any
class or profession. "I know," Bolingbroke wrote to him, "how
desirous you are to keep fair with orders, whatever liberties you take
with particular men,"<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> and he confessed that this motive "was what
chiefly stopped his going on" with his ethical scheme. "I could
not have said what I would have said without provoking every
church on the face of the earth, and I did not care for living always
in boiling water."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> He had never intended at any time to risk an
attack from the clergy, and when the danger came unexpectedly, it
was he himself that "fled trembling from the heels" of threatening
foes.</p>

<p>His special fear of Warburton was not without cause. Warburton
was the friend of Pope's enemies, Concannen and Theobald, and
held Pope cheap both as a man and a poet. Of the poet he wrote to
Concannen, Jan. 2, 1727, that Pope "borrowed for want of genius."<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
Of the man he wrote to Hurd, Jan. 2, 1757, "Till his letters were
published, I had as indifferent an opinion of his morals as the
gentlemen of the Dunciad pretended to have. Mr. Pope knew this,
and had the justice to own to me that I fairly followed appearances
when I thought well of them, and ill of him."<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The Essay on Man
was especially obnoxious to Warburton. He said that it was collected
"from the worst passages of the worst authors,"<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> and that the
doctrines were "rank atheism."<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> He did not confine his denunciation
of the poem to conversation, but refuted its vicious principles
in some formal dissertations which he read at a literary club in
Newark.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> The Dunciad faction, we may be certain, were careful
to circulate his asperities, and Pope assisted the malignity of the
Dunces by keeping his ears open to all the ill they reported. Warburton
had now shown his quality by his treatise on the Alliance
between Church and State, and the first books of the Divine
Legation. The poet, who was quailing under the assaults of
Crousaz, might well be alarmed lest a more formidable enemy should
speak to the world the criticisms he propagated in conversation, and
in his addresses to the Newark Club. In theology and metaphysics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
he was far beyond Pope's "philosopher and guide." He was even
more dictatorial and abusive, more over-bearing and contemptuous,
more ingenious in his sophistries, and not more scrupulous in the
use of his weapons. His moral obliquities, which have half-ruined
his reputation with posterity, were of a kind to increase the apprehensions
of Pope, who must have submitted in helpless silence to the
sweeping, haughty, scornful exposure of the Essay on Man.</p>

<p>When the storm had begun to burst on the defenceless head of
Pope, Warburton saw reason to go over to his side, and in December,
1738, commenced an anonymous reply to Crousaz in a monthly publication
called the Works of the Learned. An equitable judgment
was not among the merits of Warburton. His dogmatic violence
could not brook the least concession to an opposing view, and he was
always in extremes. While he herded with "the gentlemen of the
Dunciad" he was uncompromising in his censure of Pope. He
suddenly transferred his advocacy to the enemy, and indulged, with
a daring defiance of consistency, in a wild exaggeration of Pope's
powers, and a hardy denial of his errors and defects. The man who
"borrowed for want of genius," became "the last of the poetic line
amongst us, on whom, the large patrimony of his whole race is
devolved."<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> He had not only inherited the entire gifts of all poets
of all times, "he was the maker of a new species of the sublime, so
new that we have yet no name for it, though of a nature distinct
from every other known beauty of poetry." "The two great perfections
in works of genius," Warburton goes on, "are wit and
sublimity. Many writers have been witty; some have been sublime;
and a few have even possessed both these qualities separately. But
none, that I know of, besides our poet, hath had the art to incorporate
them. This seems to be the last effort of the imagination to poetical
perfection."<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> A single example of Pope's witty sublime is specified by
Warburton,&mdash;the comparison of Newton to the ape. Unfortunately,
this instance of the "new species of the sublime,"&mdash;"so new that
we have yet no name for it,"&mdash;was copied from a Latin poet of the
sixteenth century, and was a false conceit without a spark of
sublimity or wit.</p>

<p>With the change in his view of Pope's genius, there was a complete
revolution in Warburton's estimate of the Essay on Man. The
work ceased to be made up "from the worst passages of the worst
authors." A superlative originality took the place of ignorant
plagiarism, and "he uttered heavy menaces," says Bishop Law,
"against those who presumed to insinuate that Pope borrowed anything
from any man whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> The "rank atheism," in like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
manner, was converted into the purest orthodoxy, and every line
breathed forth piety and sound philosophy. "He follows truth,"
said his advocate, "uniformly throughout."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> The strain of sickening
adulation in which Warburton conveyed his newly-born admiration
showed that arrogance was not more congenial to his nature than
servility, and both were rivalled by the effrontery with which he
spoke of those who shared his old opinions. He and the "gentlemen
of the Dunciad" had agreed in thinking ill of Pope's morals,
but the conviction was genuine with Warburton, and "pretence" in
them.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> He declaimed against the "rank atheism" of the Essay on
Man, but the freethinkers who had believed that Pope was of
"their party" had "affectedly embraced the delusion."<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>Warburton's accusations of insincerity were the more unblushing
that his recantation was partly feigned. When he published his
defence of three epistles of the Essay on Man, he said that Pope's
"strong and delicate reasoning ran equally through all" the poem,
but that "the turn of the fourth epistle being more popular seemed
to need no comment."<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> His real motive for passing over the fourth
epistle was very different, and comes out in a letter to Dr. Birch,
Oct. 25, 1739. "I have been looking over, <i>inter nos</i>, the fourth
epistle of the Essay on Man; for I have a great inclination to make
an analysis of that to complete the whole. I find this part of my
defence of Mr. Pope as difficult as a confutation of Mr. Crousaz's
nonsense, and a detection of the translator's blunders, are easy. I
do not know whether I can do it to my mind, or whether I shall do
it at all, so beg you would keep it secret."<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> He left the fourth
epistle undefended because it was almost beyond his powers of
sophistry to devise a defence, and professed to the world that "the
strong and delicate reasoning was too popular to need a comment."
Having undertaken the "difficult" task, he kept up the dissimulation,
justified every doctrine the epistle contained, and lauded it, in
common with the rest of the work, for its "exact reasoning," and
for "a precision, force, and closeness of connection rarely to be met
with, even in the most formal treatises of philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> His want
of sincerity would be self-evident without the contradiction between
his confidential confessions, and his public praise. No one, with his
knowledge of philosophical divinity, could possibly have magnified
Pope in good faith for the qualities in which he was deplorably
deficient.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Dodsley, the bookseller, was present at the first interview between
Pope and Warburton, and was astonished at the compliments the
poet paid to his commentator.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> There was no occasion for astonishment.
Pope's despiser had turned idolater, "the gentlemen of the
Dunciad" had lost their ablest ally, the thrust of Crousaz had been
parried, and the champion was the dreaded man who was expected
to be a fatal foe. The sensitive novice in philosophy, who was
incompetent to fight, and could not endure defeat, was relieved
from future as well as present fears. He would not henceforward
be answerable to theological and metaphysical assailants. Warburton
had assumed the responsibility of the poem, and his irascible,
pugnacious vanity was a pledge that he would defend his certificate
of orthodoxy with his usual violence, disdain, and ability. The
relief to the mind of the anxious poet was immense, and fully
explains his headlong gratitude. He immediately renounced his
deistical interpretation of the Essay, and adopted all the views of
his thundering advocate. "I know I meant just what you explain,"
wrote the obsequious poet, April 11, 1739, "but I did not explain my
own meaning as well as you." He was too eager to live under
Warburton's protection to retain a particle of independence. No
matter how incredible might be the interpretations which his commentator
often fathered upon him, he hastened to accept every one
of them without reserve. The public were not deluded, and a letter
of Dr. Middleton to Warburton, Jan. 7, 1740, is a fair specimen,
expressed in friendly terms, of the common opinion. "You have
evinced the orthodoxy of Mr. Pope's principles, but, like the old
commentators on his Homer, will be thought, perhaps, in some
places to have provided a meaning for him that he himself never
dreamed of. However, if you did not find him a philosopher, you
will make him one, for he will be wise enough to take the benefit of
your reading, and make his future essays more clear and consistent."
Pope's moral laxity was not the only cause of the facility with
which he changed his creed. The shallowness of his convictions had
a share in the event. He had no real insight into theology, natural
or revealed. He rejected christianity because his associates sneered
at it, and because the age was irreligious. Ignorant of the right
road, he was sometimes persuaded that all roads led to a common
goal, or he adopted the road which was pointed out to him by
his guides. The Essay on Man would never have been written
unless Bolingbroke had dictated the subject, and supplied the
materials, and Pope was subdued by his dogmatism rather than
enlightened by his arguments. The speculations the poet versified
had not proceeded from his own mind; he believed as he was
prompted; and he had not any rooted convictions to sacrifice when
a second dogmatist provided him with more convenient opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Pope would have been glad "to dwell in ambiguities for ever."
In accepting the advocacy of Warburton he was obliged to abandon
his equivocal attitude, and disavow the deistical creed. "The infidels
and libertines," Warburton wrote to Dr. Stukeley, January 1, 1740,
"prided themselves in thinking Mr. Pope of their party. I thought
it of use to religion to show so noble a genius was not; and I can
have the pleasure of telling you (and have Mr. Pope's own authority
for it), that he is not."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> His chief difficulty must have been to cast off
his allegiance to his "philosopher and guide, the master of the poet
and the song." But his reputation was at stake, and he did not
hesitate. His anxiety to disclaim all sympathy with the theology of
the teacher who had furnished the arguments of his poem was shown
by one of his habitual frauds. He published, in 1741, his correspondence
with Swift, and in the printed letter of December, 1725,
he says, "Lord B. is above trifling; when he writes of anything in
this world, he is more than mortal: if ever he trifles it must be when
he turns a divine." A copy of the letter is among the Oxford papers
at Longleat, and there we find that the words he really used were,
"Lord B. is above trifling; he is grown a great divine." Pope
reversed the language of the original passage that he might seem
to the world to have contemned the divinity of Bolingbroke long
before the Essay on Man appeared. The fraud had the intended
effect with Pope's friends. Lord Mansfield inferred from the fabricated
version that "Pope not only condemned but despised the
futility of Bolingbroke's reasoning against revelation;" and Warburton
quoted the sentence for an evidence of Pope's opinion "that
no subject but religion could have sunk his lordship so far below the
class of reputable authors."<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Bolingbroke, ignorant of the trick,
remained upon cordial terms with Pope, and did not outwardly resent
his defection. The discarded master had a double motive for
his forbearance. No man was more vulnerable, and he would have
feared to provoke the malignity of the satirist. He was anxious in
his life-time to conceal his infidelity from the outer world, and he
could not expose the inconsistencies of the poet without revealing his
own unbelief. "I have been a martyr of faction in politics," he
once wrote to Pope, "and have no vocation to be so in philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
Inwardly he was deeply mortified that "the song" he had inspired
should be wrested to a meaning he disowned, that his admiring
scholar should bow down no longer to his sceptical sophistries, and
that the idol who supplanted him should belong to that priestly order
of which he never spoke without scorn. His suppressed indignation,
inflamed by fresh offences, broke out after Pope was dead.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>

When the orthodox meaning imposed on the Essay had once been
accepted by the poet, he was anxious to use the new interpretation
to silence or conciliate his opponents abroad. He immediately got
Warburton's reply to Crousaz translated into French,<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> and employed
Ramsay, a Scotchman, who had been Fénelon's secretary, to write
to Louis Racine, April 28, 1742, and assure him that he was mistaken
when he said in his poem <i>La Religion</i>,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Sans doute qu'à ces mots, des bords de la Tamise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quelque abstrait raisonneur, qui ne se plaint de rien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dans son flegme anglican répondra, "Tout est bien."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ramsay told the French poet that Pope did not think all was "right"
in mankind. He believed them fallen from their primitive condition,
and his life-long faith was evidence of his real convictions. "He is
a very good catholic," says his apologist, "and has always kept to
the religion of his forefathers in a country where he had many
temptations to abandon it." A letter addressed by Pope to Racine in
the following September upholds the statement that he was a "good
catholic," for he declares that his views are "conformable to those of
Pascal and Fénelon, the latter of whom," says he, "I would most
readily imitate in submitting all my opinions to the decision of the
church."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> His sincerity may be doubted when he professed his
readiness to accept the decisions of the romish church for a law.
The Essay on Man was already completed, or far advanced, when
Bolingbroke wrote to him, "I do not expect from you the answer I
should be sure to have from persons more orthodox than I know you
to be in the faith of the pretended catholic church. Such persons
would insist on the authority of the church."<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Pope could not,
indeed, be a romanist when he had not yet emerged from deism, and
he was not a romanist some twelvemonth after his letter to Racine,
when he said to Warburton, "that he was convinced that the church
of Rome had all the marks of the anti-christian power predicted in
the New Testament." Warburton enquired why he did not publicly
renounce a church he allowed to be corrupt. "There were," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
replied, "but two reasons that kept him from it: one, that the doing
so would make him a great many enemies, and the other that it
would do nobody else any good."<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Either his persuasion that an
unconditional submission was due to the decisions of the romish
church, must have been a transitory belief which commenced a short
time before his letter to Racine, and ceased a short time after, or
else he used deceptive language in his letter that he might convince
Racine of his orthodoxy. His explanations did not alter the French
poet's opinion on the infidel tendency of the Essay on Man. "After
the letter he wrote me," says Racine, "I am far from suspecting
him of designing to preach deism, but I am obliged to confess that
we seem to detect it in the midst of all his abstract reasonings, and
that it even presents itself so naturally that we may attribute to it
the rapid spread of the poem in France."<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>Pope's letter was forwarded to Racine by Ramsay, who accompanied
it with a second letter of his own, in which he again dwelt on his
friend's continuous and disinterested adherence to romanism. "I
am assured that a princess who admired his works, wished, when she
ruled over England, to induce him not to abandon, but to dissimulate
his religion. She was desirous of procuring him considerable appointments,
and promised that the customary oaths should be dispensed
with. He refused these offers with immoveable firmness. Such a
sacrifice was not the act of a sceptic or a deist."<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Ramsay does not
say that he received the anecdote from Pope, but he was writing in
concert with him, and on his behalf, and there is a strong presumption
that the poet had sanctioned the fable. To dispense with the
customary oaths would have been a breach of the act of settlement,
and the assertion of the power would have cost Anne her crown, and
Pope his office. This immense and abortive sacrifice was to have
been made in the interests of a man whom the queen had never seen,
who was politically insignificant, and whose moderate wants she
could have supplied from her private purse. The ludicrous invention,
which could only pass current with a foreigner ignorant of
the English constitution, was a magnified version of Lord Oxford's
hollow talk. "He used often," said Pope, "to express his concern
for my continuing incapable of a place, which I could not make
myself capable of without giving a great deal of pain to my parents,
such pain, indeed, as I would not have given to either of them for
all the places he could have bestowed upon me."<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Lord Oxford,
who trusted chiefly to duplicity and petty artifices for obtaining
support, was accustomed to amuse every one who came near him
with hopes, and evade their fulfilment by paltry excuses. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
cheap lamentation that Pope was disqualified for an office is a sad
downfall from the magnanimous offer of the Queen to provide him
with a place in defiance of law, and at the risk of her throne. If
the anecdote had been true, Ramsay's inference that Pope was an
orthodox romanist would have been wrong. His reason for not
"making himself capable of a place" was the pain his abjuration of
romanism would have given his parents. He did not pretend to
plead conscience.</p>

<p>The system of philosophy set forth in the poem is now to be considered.
Few persons could have been less qualified than Bolingbroke
and Pope to write on natural religion. The desultory superficial
investigations of Bolingbroke were under the dominion of his
passions, and Pope had barely thought upon the subject at all.
They both took for their motto a sentence from Foster, a dissenting
minister,&mdash;"Where mystery begins religion ends,"<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>&mdash;and it did not
occur to them that no mystery could be greater than the first article
of their own deistical creed,&mdash;the necessary existence of God.
Atheism magnifies the mystery, which is an inherent ingredient in
every system, religious or infidel. The least reflection forces this
fact upon the mind, and the blindness of Pope and Bolingbroke to
a truth which met them at the threshold of their speculations, and
recurred at every turn, is not an unjust measure of their general
incapacity for religious philosophy.</p>

<p>The Essay on Man was framed on the old and obvious division
of ethics, which treated of man in his relation to God, his fellow-creatures,
and himself. Pope, who thought it presumption to study
God,<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> passed over the first of the three heads, and substituted an
epistle on man in relation to the universe. The leading arguments
in this opening epistle were taken from the Théodicée of Leibnitz,
the Moralists of Shaftesbury, and the Origin of Evil, by Archbishop
King. The poet had read the essay of Shaftesbury, and had possibly
looked into King; but of Leibnitz he was entirely ignorant. In
reply to the charge of having adopted the alleged fatalism of the
illustrious German, he wrote to Warburton, Feb. 2, 1739, "It cannot
be unpleasant to you to know that I never in my life read a line
of Leibnitz, nor understood there was such a term as pre-established
harmony till I found it in M. Crousaz's book." Bolingbroke had
instructed Pope that Leibnitz was "one of the vainest and most
chimerical men that ever got a name in philosophy, and that he was
so often unintelligible that no man ought to believe he understood
himself."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> Naturally Pope had not the least suspicion that some
of the principal tenets instilled into him by his "guide" were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
filched without acknowledgment from this vain, chimerical, unintelligible
man.</p>

<p>The optimism of Leibnitz has been a thousand times misrepresented,
not because his Théodicée is obscure, but because the scoffers
had never read the system they decried. He was supposed to have
maintained that our little globe, taken separately, was the best
which could be conceived, and that all the trials and crimes of men
were in their own independent nature a good. Voltaire was among
the ignorant, and to refute the doctrine that everything was good, he
concocted a licentious tale, in which everything is vice, injustice,
and misery. His satire has a double flaw. He gives a false representation
of human life, and of the optimism of Leibnitz. The
world of Leibnitz is not our earth in its present state, but the
universe, unlimited in extent, and eternal in duration. The final
purpose of the Deity in his stupendous scheme is the best that can
be, and the means are the best for their end. The fitness of the
several parts can only be estimated in their relation to the whole,
and the whole is not creation at any moment of time, but the evolution
of the universe from everlasting to everlasting. It would be
folly to judge the evils of the hour in their isolation, when they are
incidents in an illimitable plan, and have reference to the greatest
ultimate good. To show in detail how all the evils we experience are
subservient to the best conceivable scheme of the universe, would
require that we should know the infinite design of God, that we
should be able to picture the infinity of other possible worlds, and to
institute a comparison between these infinite infinities. A morsel of
flesh, or a splinter of bone, bears an immeasurably larger proportion
to our frame than our existing globe to the existing universe, which
is itself but a link in the eternal chain, and yet a person ignorant of
the human structure would in vain attempt to explain the purpose
and fitness of some diminutive fragment of man.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>Leibnitz took for granted, in their greatest latitude, the power,
wisdom, and goodness of God. Upon this supposition, Hume, personating
the character of a sceptic, allowed that there "might,
perhaps, be a plausible solution of the ill phenomena." But the
sceptic objects that "the Deity is known to us solely in his productions,
that the universe shows only a particular degree of wisdom
and goodness, and that we can never be authorised to infer a further
degree of these attributes, which would be adding something to
the attributes of the cause beyond what appears in the effects."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
The objection would be sound if the whole series of effects were
unfolded to our view. They extend, on the contrary, indefinitely
beyond our capacity to follow them, and the question is, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the defects appertain to the attributes of God, or whether the appearance
of imperfection is the consequence of our ignorance. The
answer is not doubtful. There is superabundant proof that our
globe is framed upon a plan in which animals and things have a
mutual dependence. Our globe itself, again, is a portion of a larger
system, and we have an irresistible conviction that the boundless
universe is the work of one Author, and that a definite purpose pervades
the whole. With this first fact we couple a second, that the
appropriateness of the details in a complicated contrivance cannot be
understood, unless we comprehend the general principle of the contrivance,
and the relation of its parts. The optimism of Leibnitz is
the only just inference from these facts. A speck of creation is submitted
to our examination, and the evidences of power, wisdom, and
goodness are vast and overwhelming. Other parts seem defective, as
inevitably happens when our knowledge is miserably inadequate;
and, in accordance with experience, we conclude that our enormous
ignorance is at fault, and not that the superlative workman is inconsistent.
The explanation of the optimist is rational, while that of
the sceptic involves a gratuitous contradiction, and is wild, improbable,
and unsupported.</p>

<p>Hume's spokesman enforces his view by an instance which was
the favourite argument of Bolingbroke. "A more impartial distribution
of rewards and punishments," says the sceptic, in allusion to
a future state, "must proceed from a greater regard to justice and
equity."<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Admit that the justice of God's government on earth is,
in a single instance, imperfect, and it follows that the argument for
the perfection of His attributes is at an end. The fallacy is in the
assumed fact, that a greater regard would be shown to equity, if
rewards in this life were exactly proportioned to merits. The chief
purpose of the present life is clearly not happiness but excellence.
The characters of good men are disciplined and purified here to fit
them for happiness hereafter, and the trials which best prepare them
for eternal felicity cannot be a deviation from equity. "Every
branch," says our Lord, "that beareth fruit, my father purgeth it,
that it may bring forth more fruit,"<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> which is a stronger evidence of
fatherly care than an injurious distribution of rewards and punishments
on the sceptical plan. Physical evils become a blessing when
they are the lasting corrective of sin.</p>

<p>The moral evil itself can in part be explained. The mind and
body of human beings, and the world in which we live, have been
fixed for us by the Creator. The will alone is free, and it is the
will which really constitutes the man. Without freedom of will
there could be no morality, any more than a tree is moral when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
flourishes, and immoral when it withers. Freedom pre-supposes a
power to do wrong, and without this liberty there could be no
individual worth. The frailty of man grows out of his supremacy.
Warburton denied that there was any force in the explanation,
since if "God had only brought those creatures into being
who would not have abused their freedom, evil had been prevented
without intrenching upon free will."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Two principles are here
assumed to be indisputable, neither of which are self-evident, or
capable of proof. Warburton supposes it to be intuitively certain
that a picked race of moral agents, who must be limited in their
perfections because they are inferior to God, may all be gifted with
an infallible power of defying sin, which for aught we know may be
impossible. A christian divine must admit that some of the angels
fell, and for anything we can tell the steadfast angels might have
sinned without the warning example of their apostate brethren.
Warburton further supposes it to be intuitively certain, that if
perchance there may be a hierarchy too lofty to have ever erred, the
non-existence of the multitudinous lesser beings would be preferable
to their existence with an admixture of evil, which is not the sentiment
raised in human minds by the contemplation of the living
creatures of our globe. On the contrary, the deepest philosophers
and simplest peasants are alike lost in admiration at the spectacle,
and feel impotent to rise to a fitting height of love and praise. As
the latent premises of Warburton are not manifest facts, he has
failed to make good his position, that to all appearance God could
have framed a better world from which every semblance of evil might
have been excluded. The moral nature of man goes far to account
for the evil of man, and for his present probation. The comparative
innocence of children is lovely, but it is innocence which has not
been tried, and when it is tested it fails. The innocence of saints is
the innocence which has passed through the terrible experience of
sin, which knows the degradation of iniquity, which has fought
against it and triumphed, and hence it is the second and acquired
innocence which endures. The innocence of Adam in Paradise may
have resembled the inexperience of the child, and the only road to
permanent victory may be through defeat. Heaven itself may be
a place of temptation unless an energy of conquering will has been
first developed, and we have grown strong by an inherent homage to
righteousness. In our world, at least, felicity is not the securest
situation for untried virtue. This is enough to justify to our understandings
the state of man upon earth, though much is mysterious
in the details from our imperfect knowledge of the ultimate effect
upon aggregate humanity of the discipline of life, and our ignorance
of the part which our race is to play in the eternal universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
   Leibnitz divided evil into moral evil or sin, physical evil or
suffering, and metaphysical evil or the limitation of our endowments.
He addressed men who were satisfied from the evidence of their
internal nature and the external world that God was absolute in
power, wisdom, and goodness. Hence, whatever is, is right. "We
judge," says Leibnitz, "by the event; since God has so done it
would not be possible to do better."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Pope starts from the
premise of Leibnitz. He assumes the infinite wisdom of the Deity,
and concludes that this wisdom must have formed the best possible
system. But to a great extent he differed from Leibnitz with
regard to the cause of the several kinds of evil, and his optimism
was of an adulterate, untenable kind. He did not allow that
moral evil was the pernicious abuse of a free will, with which
we are endowed because men are preferable to automatons, moral
agents to passive machines. He held that moral evil was in
itself a good, and that God was the author of it. He it is who
"pours fierce ambition into Cæsar's mind," and nature no more
requires "men for ever temperate, calm, and wise," than "eternal
springs and cloudless skies."<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> Since the sin of men is imposed upon
them by God they must be machines after all, and of a debased and
often devilish species. An inexorable fatalism becomes the law of
humanity, and Borgias, Catilines, and Cæsars are destructive wheels
which simply obey the motion impressed upon them by the omnipotent
architect. God can do no wrong; man is the puppet of God;
and whatever is, is consequently right, the villanies of miscreants
included. The Essay swarms with contradictions, and in other
passages Pope treats man as an accountable being who departs from
the commands of his Maker.</p>

<p>Of physical evil, or suffering, Pope notices only "plagues, earthquakes,
and tempests," which he justifies by the remark that God
"acts not by partial, but by general laws."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Bolingbroke gave the
same explanation. Either, he said, such visitations are "rational
chastisements," or they are "the mere effects, natural though contingent,
of matter and motion in a material system, put into motion
under certain general laws."<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Individuals, that is, must suffer that
the laws of matter may not be infringed. Leibnitz rejected the
principle. "That which is an evil," he said, "for me would not
cease to be an evil because it would be good for some one else. The
good which pervades the universe consists, among other things, in
this, that the general good is the particular good of every one who
loves the author of all good." So, he says again, "we suffer often
from the misdeeds of others, but when we have no share in the crime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
we may hold it for certain that the sufferings procure us a greater
happiness."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> The system of Pope subordinates moral agents to
physical, and he finds it a sufficient vindication that the mechanical
law is general, and the injury to men only occasional. Whatever
may be the worth of particular persons, he believes that they are
properly sacrificed to the regularity of material laws, which roll on
with undistinguishing, terrific might, crushing any thinking, sentient,
virtuous being who may happen to cross their path. He
supposes, nevertheless, that these unbending, undiscerning laws have
undergone a "change," and, what is singular, the alteration has
been from better to worse, whereby he accounts for a portion of the
prevalent physical evil.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Another portion he at one time ascribed to
"chance," which had intruded itself into the arrangements of the
Almighty, and overruled his designs.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> The optimism which represented
man to be the sport of mechanical laws, of deteriorating
changes in the physical system, and of blind, ungovernable chance,
was not an optimism to clear away difficulties, and silence objections.</p>

<p>Metaphysical evil, or the limitation of endowments, is inevitable
in every being below the Godhead, and Pope contends that the best
system must manifestly consist in an infinite series of creatures,
from the greatest to the least. The notion is found in Locke and
Leibnitz. There are beings, said the latter, above and below us, or
there would be a void in the order of species.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> The idea was more
fully developed by Archbishop King, and is simply an extension to
the universe of the terrestrial system, where a gradation of beings on
a connected plan is the law. Pope carried the principle to extravagance.
He contends that the omission of the smallest creature would
break the chain, would throw the universe into confusion, and involve
all creation in a common ruin.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> To keep the universe from tumbling
to pieces, "it is plain," according to him, that "there must be somewhere
such a rank as man,"<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> and the rule holds equally of the
minutest animalcule on the globe. There is a flaw in his premises.
It is not apparent that the extinction of the flea would upset the
universe, nor that the scale of beings must necessarily be the same
which at present prevails. The facts are against the "must be" of
Pope. There was a time when other creatures were, and man
was not, and when animated nature was able to dispense with the
human race. Infinite wisdom must form the best possible system
and a gradation of beings, which now includes man, is an actual part
of the scheme. Pope's argument breaks down when, to justify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the creation of man, he supposes that a chain of beings and an
orderly universe could not have existed unless man had been a link
in the series. His argument is equally weak when he maintains
that the infinite wisdom of God is a guarantee that there will not
be a gap in the endless chain of existences, but that it is a question
whether infinite wisdom may not have made a mistake with respect
to man's proper place in the series, and erred in the after sorting
of the gradations which it had previously conceived and created
on an infallible plan.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> The poet was inconsistent to childishness.
Johnson believed that when Pope talked of man's place he
did not attach any meaning to the term. The words would seem to
imply that it was a question whether man was placed in the circumstances
which were best adapted to his moral, mental, and physical
nature. But if Pope had thoroughly comprehended his borrowed
phrases, he would not have proposed the enquiry under a form which
stultified his premises.</p>

<p>There were errors enough in Pope's doctrine without the misinterpretations
of Voltaire, who has falsified the views of the poet,
as he had previously misstated the profounder system of Leibnitz.
"Those," says Voltaire, "who exclaim that all is good are charlatans.
Shaftesbury, who brought the fable into fashion, was a very
unhappy man. I have seen Bolingbroke devoured with chagrin and
rage, and Pope, whom he induced to put the mockery into verse, was
as much to be pitied as any man I have ever known,&mdash;deformed in
body, unequal in his temper, always ill, a burthen to himself, and
harassed by a hundred enemies to his dying hour. Quote me at
least some happy men who say that all is good. Any one who had
seen the beautiful Ann Boleyn, and the still more beautiful Mary
Stuart, in their youth, would have said that is good, but would he
have said it when he saw them perish by the hand of the executioner?
would he have said it when he saw the grandson of the beautiful
Mary die the same death in the midst of his capital? would he have
said it when he saw the great-grandson more unfortunate still, since
he lived longer?"<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> Pope, in his imperfect theory, did not deny the
existence of sorrow, but asserted, or implied, that the sorrow was an
advantage either to the sufferer or others. Voltaire looked singly at
the misery without heeding the gain. Mary Queen of Scots at the
block was superior to the radiant beauty who was starting on a
profligate career. Charles I., penitent for his murderous abandonment
of Strafford, and, perhaps, for his creed that duplicity is
a virtue when employed by kings to circumvent subjects, was a
vastly better man on the scaffold than on the throne. James II. was
in a more advantageous position with the inducement to repentance
which his long exile supplied than if he had succeeded in his fraudulent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
attempts to subvert the English church and constitution. The
rage of Bolingbroke, and Pope's fretful temper, were certainly inexplicable
on the pretence that they were poured into the mind by the
Deity. They did not militate against the truer optimism which saw
in them self-imposed vice and pain, rendered possible by the free-will
which is a privilege to mankind.</p>

<p>Pope filled up the outline of his system with declamatory invectives
against objectors, and with reflections intended to prove
that the imperfections of man befitted his position in the universe.
There is little force in the poet's reasoning. He passes over difficulties,
and replies to cavils which no one worth answering ever
urged. Some of his remarks are obscure, some erroneous, some
common-place. Such as they are they have not been woven into a
consecutive argument. M. Crousaz says he knew persons who were
persuaded that Pope had tacked together a number of fragments
he had composed at different times, before he had the idea of an
Essay on Man, which was a contrivance to work up his collection
of odds and ends. He understood, in fact, little beyond the separate
thoughts, and was insensible to the want of coherence, consistency
and purpose. It would be lost labour to search, like Warburton,
for a strength and closeness of reasoning which were not in the
mind of the author.</p>

<p>The second epistle treats of man "with respect to himself as an
individual." The Bible is a revelation of God, and a perpetual
summons to mankind "to know and understand" him. "Thus
saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, but let
him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth
me."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> The divinity at last descended upon earth, and lived our
life, acting and speaking under our circumstances, that God might
be clearly manifested to the world. "He that hath seen me," says
our Lord, "hath seen the Father."<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> The divine light appeared
darkness and imposture to Pope. He was even blind to the light
which his natural understanding would have furnished, and, taught
by Bolingbroke, he abjured all pretension to a knowledge of the
Almighty under the plea of reverencing his inscrutable grandeur.
Man must not venture to scan God; his only proper study is to
learn to know himself.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> This second epistle exhibits the kind of
self-knowledge to which Pope attained, when, renouncing the knowledge
of God, he determined to limit his investigations to man.</p>

<p>He draws a desolate picture. Man is in doubt whether he is a
god or a beast; whether he ought to prefer his body or his mind.
He is a confused chaos of thought and passion, he reasons only to
err, and is only born to die.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The general incapacity, we are told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
extended to Newton, and it might have occurred to the poet that it
was a useless task to study our nature when the deductions of
reason in its highest estate are uniformly wrong. He committed
the oversight from his habit of borrowing fragments he was not at
the pains to understand. His caricature was a partial and distorted
copy from Pascal, who with wonderful energy of language, amplified
the helplessness of fallen man that he might insist the more strongly
on the necessity of his restoration through the Gospel. He overcharged
the evil to exalt the remedy. Pope had not any remedy to
suggest. He leaves the "confused chaos" in its primitive impotence,
and calls upon mankind to embark in a deceptive study, with
the warning that they will wander from error to error.</p>

<p>Without tying Pope down to the rhetorical exaggerations in the
opening paragraph of his second epistle, we find from a passage in
the first epistle that he reduced to insignificance the self-knowledge
attainable by mankind. He said that when the proud horse and
dull ox knew why man put them to this use or that, then would
proud and dull man comprehend the end and use of his being,
passions, sufferings, and actions.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> The amount of knowledge possessed
by the horse and ox is not discoverable by us. The only nature
adequately known to man is his own, and his nature reveals his end.
The ideas which ought to govern him proceed from his Maker. They
are the voice of God speaking to him, and telling him the purpose
for which he lives. He learns, above all, that he is the servant of
the Almighty, that his passions are to be ruled by his conscience,
that duty is supreme, that his sufferings are the discipline to perfect
his character, that earth is the school for a higher existence. He
may be negligent and perverse; he may refuse to look into his
nature, and may, in part, defy it; may thence arrive at false conclusions,
and adopt a false course of conduct, which are the abuses
of a free-will that can sink or soar, but the grand outlines of his
nature are plain to every honest and earnest enquirer, and blank
ignorance on the end of his being, passions, sufferings, and actions
is not the inevitable condition of man.</p>

<p>The conviction that we are ignorant of the use of our being and
actions did not keep Pope from acknowledging that "good" is the
end to which we aspire.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> The nature of this good, and the means of
obtaining it, is the main subject of the second epistle, "which contains,"
says Warburton, "the truest, clearest, shortest, and consequently
the best system of ethics that is anywhere to be met with."<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
The system which Warburton thought "true and clear" appears to
be eminently false and contradictory.</p>

<p>Man has certain implanted tendencies, physical, intellectual, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
sympathetic,&mdash;the craving for food, for knowledge, for society, etc.
None of our primitive endowments can be termed moral, since they
are bestowed upon us independently of our will, and it is not till
will interposes that morality begins, but in their purity they are all
advantageous, and many of them are directed to the identical end
which morality prescribes. They are part of the stock-in-trade with
which man starts in his career, and he is charged with the wise
administration of them. A brief experience teaches him that an
instinctive tendency may be carried to excess. His craving for food
and drink may turn to gluttony and drunkenness; his passion for
knowledge may convert him into a solitary student without any care
for his kind; his love of society and affection may unfit him for the
business and drudgery of life. Or he may yield to a propensity till
satiety succeeds, and he is left listless and jaded. Or he may
indulge a lawful propensity by lawless methods. Or he may be
hurried away by successive impulses, and be too unstable to put his
gifts to a profitable use. In any of these ways his proper nature
becomes mutilated and degraded. His reason informs him that to
enjoy the full advantage of his tendencies he must not consent to be
drifted along by the current which is strongest for the moment. He
must curb the lower propensities, and foster the higher; he must
regulate the several unities in a manner to derive the greatest
benefit from the whole; he must substitute for the reign of impulse
what moralists call his interest well understood. He does not
stop at self-interest. He rises above his personal good into the
impersonal sphere of good in itself. He perceives that there is a
law superior to his individual interests, a law of universal obligation,
and which is immutable and eternal.</p>

<p>Of these three motives, the instinctive, the prudential, and the
law of independent morality, Pope rejects the last. He believes that
self is the single spring of action in men, and he seriously adopts
the old sarcastic saying, "Every man for himself, and God for us
all."<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> He divides this selfish nature into two parts,&mdash;self-love,
which designates the impulsive propensities, and reason, which governs
them on the behalf of interest well-understood.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Already
there is an inconsistency in his phraseology when he puts self-love
in direct opposition to reason. Reason in his theory is simply the
selfishness of calculation; self-love the selfishness of impulse. Self-love
is absolute in both, and is not the less self-love because we
deliberate upon the means which are best adapted to secure the
selfish end.</p>

<p>The erroneous phraseology signifies little. The important point is
the radical falsity of the system. The three grand duties of man,&mdash;his
duty to God, his neighbour, and himself,&mdash;are resolved by Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
into the single duty of man to himself. In the first epistle the poet
rebuked the pride which supposed the heavens and the earth to be
created for its use.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> In his second epistle he teaches us that they
are totally indifferent to us under any other aspect. He will tell us
that the way to promote our personal interest is to love God and our
neighbour, but the end and motive of the love must on his system be
our individual interest still. The gospel precepts must be set aside;
for in place of loving our neighbour equally with ourselves we are to
love him simply for the sake of ourselves; and in place of loving God
with all our hearts, and minds, and souls, we are to love him solely as
a tributary who ministers to our absorbing love of self. When we
practically think and act as though we were the centre of the universe;
when, horrible to say, we view the Deity merely as an instrument
to promote our selfishness; when we discover nothing in the
Creator to adore, nothing in his creation to admire, apart from their
fitness to advance the interests of one puny mortal, we invert the
actual constitution of things, we base our morality upon a lie, and
we only cheat ourselves with delusive terms when we talk of our duty
to God and our neighbour.</p>

<p>The test of the system is in the phenomena of consciousness which
are open to universal observation. When our moral principle is an
unalloyed selfishness we seek our private good alone, and there can
be no obligation to consult the interests of our neighbours. I pay a
debt because it is to my advantage, and not from any sense of what
is due to my debtor. I forbear to kill, and maim, and torture, not in
the least because I am bound to consider the rights and feelings of
my fellow-creatures, but because it would be present or future pain
to myself. Owning no law, except the law of selfishness, I should be
dishonest and cruel if I could believe that the balance of personal
pleasure was on the side of inhumanity and roguery. When I blame
murderers and thieves, I inconsiderately distinguish between the guilt
and folly of the crime, which is a vulgar mistake. The selfishness
which respects nothing beyond the requirements of self is the law of
our race, and the miscalled criminal has obeyed the governing principle
of mankind. He owed no duty to others, and his sole fault was
not to have judged wisely for his interests. I talk of patriotism and
public spirit, of sacrifice and disinterestedness, but they are words
which convey a false impression. Sacrifice and disinterestedness do
not exist, and the apparent devotion to country and public is at bottom
a complete devotion to self.</p>

<p>Common experience is too powerful for bad philosophy, and it is
plain that this is not a true description of the moral man. Pope
puts a part for the whole. The Creator has endowed us with a
desire for happiness, which is inseparable from our being. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
individual is a portion of the universe, and though he is only an
atom, his interests are cared for in common with the rest. But he
has a consciousness that the good of others must be cared for likewise,
that Providence has enjoined him to contribute to the result,
and that his refusal to recognise the duty he owes to his neighbour
would be guilt. He has a conviction that the great source of all
being and all good is to be adored for his infinite perfections, and
that to love him solely for the sake of the blessings he communicates
to ourselves is a maimed, derogatory, and impious idea. Man has
been constructed to perceive things as they are, and to act in conformity
with his knowledge. He is the creature of his Maker, a
unit in a multitude, and could not be permitted to consider Maker
and multitude subordinate to the creature and unit, without a
complete perversion of the facts. With the desire for our own
good there has been instilled into us that law of good in itself
which embraces the universe,&mdash;a law which, while it includes
our individual concerns, extends infinitely beyond them, and to
which we do homage under its aspect of good in itself, as well as
under its aspect that it is good for me. Our personal pleasure is not
therefore, as Pope asserts, "the whole employ of body and mind."<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
Happiness in the long run is dependent upon well-doing, and we
consult our interest when we adhere to duty. But our rule of duty
must not be bounded by our self-interest, which, reducing our
motives to a petty egotism, corrupts the nature of man, and contaminates
duty at its source.</p>

<p>The prevalent habit of abandoning duty for personal pleasure
begets the mistaken idea that where there is pleasure there is absolute
selfishness. The degree of selfishness must be determined by
our motives, and not by the feelings which accompany our acts.
Whatever is done for self-gratification is selfish; and everything in
which our end is external to ourselves is disinterested, in so far as
the accompanying gratification is not the motive to the deed. Although
the benevolent man has a satisfaction in reflecting that the sufferings
of the needy are removed, his predominant motive to benevolence is
the relief of the wretched, and not his own personal pleasure. His
intention terminates in the objects of his charity, with little return
upon himself, and unless his sympathy with them was real the gratification
would not be felt. Happiness is the proper effect of pure
goodness, and if the junction of perfect happiness and perfect goodness
was incompatible with disinterestedness, the celestial spirits
would be more selfish than men. Men, in turn, would grow selfish
in the same proportion that perseverance in well-doing rendered
duty delightful. "I find a pleasure in serving my friends," said
Schiller in refutation of the doctrine; "it is agreeable to me to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
fulfil my duties. This troubles me, for then I am no longer
virtuous."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> The love which is capable of the utmost sacrifice
is not less generous because no sacrifice may chance to be required,
any more than a man who is proof against all temptations to steal,
is less honest because he is not exposed to temptation. From
our proneness to self-deceit we are accustomed to estimate disinterestedness
by actual sacrifices, which both test our motives,
and inure us to self-denying love, but disinterestedness is the
cause of self-denial and must precede it, and the disposition remains
when the call for self-denial may have ceased. Qualities are
what they are, whatever may happen to be the surrounding circumstances.
Grant that a man can love his neighbour and himself with
an equal love, and the same proportion will be preserved whether his
love procures him unadulterated pleasure, or entails on him a vast
amount of pain. Happiness and disinterestedness are not in their
essence mutually destructive; they co-exist and coalesce.</p>

<p>A close scrutiny into the motives of moral men will satisfy us that
the love of our neighbour is not wholly or chiefly a disguised love of
self; that we love God for what he is, transcendent in goodness and
wisdom, as well as for what he is to us; that we do not bow down to
duty solely because it is our interest well understood, but much more
because it has an illimitable authority independent of our individual
interests, and binds the conscience by its right to supreme dominion.
God, man, duty are external objects which, over and above the consideration
of self-interest, are served by morality as an end. Bishop
Butler even maintained that all our instinctive impulses "are particular
movements towards particular external objects," and cannot be
ascribed to self-love. He instances the desire produced by hunger,
of which "the object and end," he says, "is merely food."<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> But there
is a further object for which alone the food is desired,&mdash;the removal of
painful sensations, or the gratification of the palate, or the prolongation
of life. All these objects are often purely selfish, and always in their
ordinary unreflecting state.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> The uneasy sensation of hunger begins
and ends with the individual; the single purpose for which he covets
the food is to allay his particular physical craving; outside self there
is no object left to attract the mind,&mdash;no over-plus to which our
thoughts can be directed. There is not, as in the case of God, man,
and law, an object which has a claim upon our hearts and understandings
distinct from the special benefit to ourselves. The desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
for food is a selfish, but not an evil instinct, for self-love is part of
the duty and constitution of man. Pope's error was in putting a
fragment for the whole, and merging duty in selfishness.</p>

<p>There is a second part to Pope's system. He has told us that the
function of reason is to "advise and check" the instinctive impulses;
that she "mixes the passions with art, and confines them to due
bounds;" that she "compounds and subjects, tempers and employs
them;" and that her "well-accorded" combination of jarring elements
"gives all the strength and colour to our life."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> The instant
after he lays down a directly opposite theory. He says that every
man brings into the world a "ruling passion," which is "cast and
mingled with his very frame;" that this master passion "grows
with our growth," and "swallows up" all the other passions; that
whatever "warms the heart or fills the head" goes to feed the one
despotic desire. When we fancy we curb a passion we are deceived;
we have only resigned a lesser passion in favour of a greater.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>
Reason, which lately mixed the passions in their proper proportions,
and confined them to due bounds, is suddenly stripped of her prerogative,
and becomes the slave of the master passion.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
The ruling passion, be it what it will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruling passion conquers reason still.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Reason in this new theory is worse than helpless; she deserts to the
side of her enemy, gives the monster propensity "edge and power,"
and exerts herself to exasperate the "mind's disease."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Such contradictions
were the natural consequence of the perfunctory manner
in which Pope had picked up his scraps of philosophy.</p>

<p>The slightest acquaintance with the world is fatal to the hypothesis
that an exclusive ruling passion is the universal characteristic of
mankind. Each person has various appetites, desires, and affections,
and it is rare to see a man in whom "one master passion has
swallowed up the rest." Propensities intermingle and take their
turn. Characters are notoriously complex, and every individual is
not the incarnation of a single unattended passion. A desire for
power may be joined with sensuality, a love of fame with covetousness,
an eagerness for knowledge with affection. In the play of
passions one may preponderate, but all the rest are not reduced to
nullity. Allow the existence of the ruling passion, and Pope's
account of its origin could not be correct. A passion which is cast
in our frame from our birth, and continues thenceforward to grow
with our growth, must be permanent and unalterable. The individual
must be governed by the same passion in childhood and
age, in the season of thoughtlessness and of wisdom, in dissoluteness
and virtue, in all the possible changes of condition. This is not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
scene which life presents. "Every observer," says Johnson, "has
remarked, that in many men the love of pleasure is the ruling
passion of their youth, and the love of money that of their advanced
years."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>With an inherited ruling passion, and reason helpless to restrain it,
we should be altogether the creatures of fate on Pope's hypothesis,
if he had not furnished reason with a last resource, which, as is
evident from several parallel passages, was chiefly suggested to him
by the works of his contemporary, Mandeville. This shallow thinker
put forth a system of morality and political economy in his Fable of
the Bees, or Private Vices, Public Benefits. The book, which was
philosophically weak, attracted much notice at the time from the
liveliness of his coarse illustrations, the vigorous ease of his inaccurate
style, and the cynical parade of his licentious doctrines. He
had the folly to imagine that commerce could only flourish when the
wealth of a nation was consumed by the idle, the sensual, the
luxurious. Hence, he argued that their wasteful vices were a national
gain. This was his political economy. His morality consisted in
denying the reality of virtue. He held that every apparent virtue
was prompted by an underlying frailty, and that all ostensible goodness
was the false mask worn over inward weaknesses. The indignation
his system provoked induced him subsequently to throw in
some qualifying phrases, but his faint, and always equivocal concessions,
are forms of speech, and did not prevent his repeated avowal
that genuine virtue had no existence on earth. "I often," he says,
"compare the virtues of good men to your large China jars; they
make a fine show, but look into a thousand of them, and you will
find nothing in them but dust and cobwebs."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>Pope, like Mandeville, founds virtue upon vice. The ruling passion
is evil, but reason gives it a bias towards good.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> "Spleen,
obstinacy, hate, and fear," each produce "crops of wit and honesty;"
"anger" is the parent of "zeal and fortitude;" "avarice" of
"prudence;" "sloth" of "philosophy;" and every virtue under
heaven may issue from "pride or shame."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> The ruling passion
having engulphed the whole family of affections and desires, this
individual is a personification of anger, that individual of hate; a
third of fear; a fourth of sloth; a fifth of pride. The sole moving
principle of man is his giant passion.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> The function of reason is
only to foster it,<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> and select the means for its gratification. Whatever
these means may be, the motive of the incarnate monster lust,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
is to feed sensuality; of the monster sloth to secure ease; of the
monster pride to inflate self-importance. "The same ambition,"
says Pope, "may make a patriot, as it makes a knave."<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> But the
incarnation of an all-pervading ambition can be only a patriot in
appearance, and uses patriotism to serve the ends of ambition. Let
the two diverge, and by the law of his nature he must fling the
patriotism to the winds. "Either," says our Lord, "make the tree
good, and his fruit good; or else, make the tree corrupt and his
fruit corrupt."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> On Pope's theory, to make the tree good is impossible.
Man has no escape from the ruling passion he brings into
the world. He must be angry, avaricious, or slothful, according to
the seed which was sown in him at his birth, and the tree must
remain corrupt to the last.</p>

<p>The fruit would inevitably betray the taint of its origin, and Pope
was mistaken in supposing that a vitiated motive could keep steady
to outward virtue. "Hate," to which Pope ascribes the singular
power of producing "crops of wit and honesty," must repudiate love,
or whatever else did not subserve the one unamiable passion; and a
man all hate,&mdash;a frantic enemy to every kind and tender emotion,&mdash;would
be hateful, however honest and witty. "Anger" would renounce
the meek and charitable, "pride" the humble virtues, together with
any other virtue which did not minister to inordinate anger and
pride. Neither passion would assume a moral aspect. "I observe,"
says Baxter, "that almost all men, good and bad, do loathe the
proud, and love the humble." "Zeal" is the prerogative ascribed
to "anger," and the zealot who was urged on by fierce unflagging
anger would be a terror and a scourge. Pope himself has drawn
a horrible picture of the miseries inflicted upon humanity when
"zeal, not charity, became the guide" of the teachers of religion.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>
"Sloth" supplies us with "philosophy," or the apathetic submission
to evils we are too lazy to correct, which is the virtue that induces
thousands to live in dirt and ignorance, because cleanliness and
knowledge are not to be had without industry. "Avarice" is
credited with the faculty of "supplying prudence," which is as true as
to say that a burning fever supplies a moderate, healthy temperature.
The moral system which confines man to the counterfeit "virtue
nearest allied to his vice," or ruling passion, is an extravagant libel
upon the virtuous, and outrageous flattery of the vicious.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Mandeville took his morality from La Rochefoucauld, and Pope
took hints from both. The principle common to the three is the
motto which La Rochefoucauld placed at the head of his Maxims,
"Our virtues are usually vices in disguise." The doctrine, when
expressed in La Rochefoucauld's language, was condemned by Pope.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>

"As L'Esprit," he said, "La Rochefoucauld, and that sort of people,
prove that all virtues are disguised vices, I would engage to
prove all vices to be disguised virtues. Neither, indeed, is
true: but this would be a more agreeable subject; and would overturn
their whole scheme."<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> He repeated the criticism in a suppressed
passage of the Essay on Man,<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> with a complete unconsciousness
that the "scheme" he fancied he could "overturn," was the very
soul of his system. "Heaven," he said, "can raise virtue's ends
from the vanity which seeks no reward but praise,"<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> and for man to be
virtuous solely out of vanity was exactly the virtue which La Rochefoucauld
called "vice in disguise." He who feeds the hungry from
vanity alone is not moved by sympathy for suffering. Charity is
merely the pretence which his vanity pleads. Each of the other
ruling passions acts according to its own exclusive nature, and the
virtue which is adopted to humour anger, hate, sloth, and avarice,
is by general consent called delusion or imposture. La Rochefoucauld
has the advantage over Pope. The succession of selfish
passions he discovered too uniformly in man is less odious than the
concentrated anger, hate, or sloth which never pauses or turns
aside; and the satirist who lashes the deceptive vices of mankind is
to be preferred to the moralist who teaches that vice in disguise is
virtue.</p>

<p>The contradictions are not at an end. Pride, folly, "even mean
self-love," have all, says Pope, some good in them.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> He forgot that
self-love is, with him, the principle of every virtue and vice, their
essence and life, their origin and end, and to call self-love meaner
than pride and folly is either to assert that self-love is meaner than
itself, or to abandon the foundation of his moral systems. He goes
on to ascribe an influence to self-love which is incompatible with his
second system, or theory of the ruling passion. "Self-love," he
says, "is the scale to measure others' wants by thine," or, as he
remarked to Spence, "self-love would be a necessary principle in
every one, if it were only to serve each as a scale for his love to his
neighbour."<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> On Pope's second system this love of each for his
neighbour must be extinct, unless love chanced to be the ruling
passion. Unmixed anger, hate, and sloth retain no trace of affection.
When we are reduced to a single passion, and for selfish purposes
"measure others' wants by our own," anger can but have an
intellectual, unsympathising perception of rival passions, and will
only assist them in the degree which will serve its irritable instincts.
Sloth, anger, hate, and the rest will act according to their kind, and
to call upon them to love their neighbours as themselves is to enjoin
the deaf to hear, and the blind to see.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>

An evil fatalism, therefore, remains the leading principle of Pope's
second system. A man must be avaricious, slothful, or angry as
nature appoints. He cannot select his passion, or divert, or repress it.
The sole power reserved to his will is a certain latitude in choosing the
diet upon which the passion feeds. This meagre and polluted freedom
dwindles to nothing with such passions as sloth and avarice, and
if there was room for prayer, when our nature is fixed for us by an
irreversible decree, we ought to petition for the "pride and vainglory"
against which we pray in the Litany, since, if Pope is right,
they permit more variety of specious virtue than the griping prudence
of avarice, and the corrupting philosophy of sloth.</p>

<p>The poet passes from his review of individual man to the designs
of God, and his degenerate morality sinks lower as he proceeds.
"The ends of Providence," he says, "and general good are answered
in our passions and imperfections," and he goes on to show "how
usefully" the Deity, acting in the interests of the "whole,"<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> has
"distributed" imperfections to "orders of men, to individuals, and
to every state and age of life."<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> Pope refuses to ascribe our evil
passions to the abuse of that freedom of will which is inseparable
from the idea of a moral being. He retains the doctrine laid down
in his first epistle, and involved in his ruling-passion hypothesis, that
our evil passions are the immediate gift of God. "Heaven applies"
what Pope calls "happy frailties to all ranks,&mdash;fear to statesmen,
rashness to commanders, and presumption to kings."<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> "Pride is
bestowed on all, a common friend,"<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> which overthrows his theory
that the ruling is our only passion, and pride incompatible with
avarice, sloth, &amp;c. The blessing he imputes to pride is that it takes
possession of the "vacuities of sense," and prevents self-knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>
"The proper study of mankind is man," but the desirable effect of
the study is that man should be self-deceived,&mdash;that he should be
soothed into complacency by ignorance of his individual defects, and
by a conceited dream of imaginary excellence. The "bubble joy" is
ordained by Providence "to laugh in the cup of folly," that folly
may be cheered in its career, and fast as "one prospect is lost" may
be lured on by "another."<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> The poet had already furnished an
illustration of his doctrine, in the consolatory fact that "the sot"
fancies himself "a hero!"<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> "Pleasure," says Pope, is "our
greatest evil or our greatest good," and these were among his good
pleasures,&mdash;the contrivances of a beneficent Deity for the comfort
and encouragement of vice and folly. Bolingbroke was better informed.
"The man," he says, "who neglects the duties of natural
religion, and the obligations of morality, acts against his nature, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
lives in open defiance to the author of it. God declares for one order
of things, he for another. God blends together the duty and interest
of his creature; his creature separates them, despises the
duty, and proposes to himself another interest."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<p>Pope is not satisfied with applauding moral imperfections. He
degrades and ridicules religious aspirations. Every period, he says,
of life is provided with "some fit passion,"<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> and as a "rattle, by
nature's kindly law," is the "plaything" of the "child," so "beads
and prayer-books are the toys of age." The new toy, like the old,
is but a "bauble," which "pleases," as the rattle had done before,
till "tired" of the game we "sleep, and life's poor play is over."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
The whole is an idle entertainment arranged by the Deity, who has
"usefully distributed" the "fit" and frivolous passions which
amuse our hollow existence. The worst writer has never given a
more debased description of the moral government of God, and of
the nature and ends of rational man. Ignorant of our Creator, presumptuous
when we dare to study him, involved in a whirl of endless
error when we study ourselves, the victims of a pre-ordained
and irresistible passion, prayer is but a beguiling "toy," and not
the reasonable, elevated language of belief, trust, and repentance.
The goal of morality is the discovery that "life is a poor play," a
paltry mimic scene, which leaves us only this barren consolation&mdash;that
though we, the actors, are "fools," "God," who has cast our
empty part for us, "is wise."<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> The wisdom is not apparent in
Pope's deplorable travestie of man's moral nature. Happily, true
morality teaches that life is a grand school in which, knowing the
adorable perfections of God, we learn to imitate his goodness. The
moral man is occupied with noble realities, and not with mimic
shows. He fights against destroying passions, struggles to conform
to immutable verities, and finds, amid many bitter failures, that
human weakness and littleness can continuously approximate to the
divine exemplar. The life, which seemed to Pope a "poor play," is
to the moral and religious man a mighty privilege, an awful responsibility,
a sublime preparation,&mdash;the prelude to a holy and happy
eternity.</p>

<p>The third epistle treats "of the nature and state of man with
respect to society." The details of our duty to our neighbour were
kept for the portion of the Essay which was never written. In the
present epistle Pope discusses the general relation of man to man, or
the foundation of society and government. A third of his dissertation
is a renewal of the argument in the previous epistles that all
things have a mutual dependence, that every creature is made both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
for others and for itself. This desultory introduction is succeeded
by the remark that "self-love and social love began with the state
of nature,"<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> which is an allusion to the argument of Hobbes, much
canvassed in Pope's day, that "the state of nature was a state of
war." Pope and Hobbes agreed that human motives were entirely
selfish. They differed in their opinion of the direction which the
selfishness took. Hobbes contended that each would desire all things
for himself, and would endeavour to despoil his neighbour; Pope,
that self-love would seek its gratification in social love. But the
poet says and unsays, and is soon involved in a labyrinth of inconsistencies.
He tells us that in the patriarchal period, "before the
name of king was known,"<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> "man, like his Maker, saw that all was
right;" "trod to virtue in the paths of pleasure;" and recognised
no "allegiance" or "policy" except "love."<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> A few lines earlier
he asserted that in the same patriarchal period, before monarchy was
known, and when all was love and virtue, some states were compelled
to join others through "fear;" and "foes," tempted by trees
laden with fruit, went forth "to ravish" the orchards of their neighbours.
And when the robbers desisted from their intended spoliation,
it was not out of love or compassion, but only because they
were persuaded by the proprietors that "commerce" would prove as
profitable as "war."<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Both these clashing theories are espoused by Pope with equal confidence,
but the greatest prominence is given to the theory that social
love was perfect in the patriarchal times. The whole of the sentient
world was included in the happy brotherhood. The human race were
the companions of the beasts, and walked, fed, and slept with them.
The disastrous circumstance which broke up the reign of universal
love was the craving of man for animal food. He yielded to the
temptation to eat flesh, and from a meek, was changed into a pugnacious,
sanguinary creature. The inflammatory diet generated the
"fury passions," till then unknown, and "turned man on man."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
"Force" was now employed to make "conquests," and war and
rapine were introduced.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Pope once more lapses into his habitual
contradictions. He represents the patriarchs as teaching their
families to "draw monsters from the abyss," and "fetch the
eagle to the ground" during the innocent era when the lives
of beasts were held sacred.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> He has thus adopted two opposite
versions of the patriarchal treatment of the animal creation, and
the later version, which teaches that the slaughter of animals was
prevalent under the reign of love and virtue, is inconsistent with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
genealogy of the "fury passions." He has likewise two opposite
opinions on the destruction of brutes,&mdash;the one, that to take their
lives was murder; the other, that the art of killing them was among
the laudable discoveries which entitled the patriarchs to be esteemed
"a second Providence" by their children.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Pope has not done with
his contradictions. "It might, perhaps," he says in his first epistle,
"appear better for us that all were harmony and virtue, and that
never passion discomposed the mind." "But all," he replies, "subsists
by elemental strife, and passions are the elements of life," which,
he urges to show the necessity for the "fierce ambition" of Cæsar,
and the misdeeds of Borgia and Catiline.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> In the third epistle we
are told that "the virtue and harmony" actually lasted for many
generations, that the strife of bad passions was not in the slightest
degree requisite for sustaining the system established on earth, and
that the aggressive vices of Cæsars, Catilines, and Borgias were only
the pernicious consequence of eating meat.</p>

<p>The hypothesis is puerile, that force, conquest, and rapine originated
in a meat diet. Equally puerile is the theory that the arts
of government, navigation, agriculture, and manufactures were
copied from animals.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> Man is specially distinguished by his inventive
capacity. Through this gift the arts and sciences are continuously
progressive, and there is no plausibility in the supposition
that his characteristic power was originally in abeyance. The gratuitous
fancy that the arts of human civilisation were acquired from
the brutes, could not be supported by less appropriate examples.
Mankind are said by Pope to have been pre-eminently social, and he
would have us believe that neither sociality nor convenience could
teach them to construct their dwellings in proximity, till "reason
late" suggested to them the reflection, that some birds, such as
rooks, built their nests in clusters.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> He acknowledges that a community
of families perceived it would be for their interest to have a
single ruler; but the principle that the subjects under a monarchy
should retain their right to their houses and property, was discovered
by observing that every bee in a hive had its separate cell, and separate
honey,<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> which was a fiction of some unobservant naturalist, who
credited bees with our usages. From the silk-worm we learn to
"weave," and from, the mole to "plough," notwithstanding that the
silk-worm only spins silk, and never weaves it, and that the subterranean
scratchings of the mole have no resemblance to our contrivance,
the plough. The remaining instances cited by Pope are just
as absurd. He strung together fragments of ancient fables, which,
in a modern copy, are neither poetry nor philosophy.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>

When families spread, patriarchal government is said by Pope to
have been invariably merged in monarchical. He makes no mention
of another elementary system which prevailed among the ancient
Germans, and which was too natural to have been unfrequent. The
tribe was composed of contiguous families, or clans, each of which
had its separate territory. The head of every clan was ruler within
his own domain, and the affairs which concerned the entire tribe
were managed by a general assembly of the heads of clans. Under
this arrangement the representative of the clan preserved his patriarchal
power, and had an equal voice with his brother chiefs in regulating
the common interests of the tribe. Pope completed his single
genealogical principle of government by a rapid summary of the transitions
through which monarchy passed. Conquest led to tyranny. An
ambitious priesthood first threatened the despot with spiritual terrors,
then went shares with him, and the double yoke of secular and ecclesiastical
tyranny was fastened on the necks of mankind. The oppressed
subjects at last rebelled against their rulers, kings were
"forced into virtue by self-defence," and the world returned to the
dominant principle of the state of nature, that "self-love and social
are the same." These meagre doctrines were derived from Bolingbroke,
whose political philosophy was hardly more profound than his
moral and metaphysical; but Pope shows, here and there, that he
had read Locke's treatise on Civil Government, and the passages from
Hooker which Locke quoted, and with such masters to guide him the
flimsiness of his views is without excuse.</p>

<p>The investigations of Pope conducted him to the final conclusion
that "the true end of all government" is unity among mankind,
and he prescribes the methods by which harmony is to be preserved
both in politics and religion. The panacea which was to cure political
divisions is contained in the couplet,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For forms of government let fools contest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er is best administered is best.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Good government, that is, depends on good administration; the form
of government is immaterial, and those who battle for one form
in preference to another, are fools. The accusation of folly was
thrown back upon the poet, who grew ashamed of his maxim, and in
1740 he gave an interpretation to his verses which they cannot be
made to bear. "The author of these lines," he said, "was far from
meaning that no one form of government is, in itself, better than
another (as that mixed or limited monarchy, for example, is not preferable
to absolute), but that no form of government, however excellent
or preferable in itself, can be sufficient to make a people happy
unless it be administered with integrity. On the contrary, the best

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
sort of government, when the form of it is preserved, and the administration
corrupt, is most dangerous." The concord which was
to have been produced by indifference to forms of government,
vanishes with the admission that the form is important. The qualifying
remark, that forms are insufficient when their spirit is violated,
was a truism denied by no one. A corrupt legislature, a corrupt
executive, and corrupt tribunals, would neutralise the benefit of any
constitution with which they could subsist.</p>

<p>Pope retracted his maxim under the pretence of explaining it.
His new version showed that he did not yet understand the value of
forms of government, or he would not have said that when the administration
is corrupt the best form of government is the most detrimental
to the public. A slight reflection on the History of England,
and the nature of man, must have convinced him that a chief virtue
of good forms of government is the security they afford for the prevention,
limitation, and cure of corruption,&mdash;for the subordination of
private selfishness to the common weal. His own epistle would have
informed him that when governors have absolute dominion they
"drive through just and unjust" to gratify their "ambition, lust,
and lucre;" and when the power is with the governed, they will not
suffer their rights to be extensively invaded, but will oblige kings
and ministers to "learn justice."<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> There was a stage of feudalism
when the territorial, legislative, and judicial functions were centered
in the lord of the fief. He taxed and punished his serfs and vassals
at pleasure. His covetousness, his cruelty, his passionate caprices,
all developed by uncontrolled habit and the spirit of the age, could
only be resisted by rebellion, and rebellions he quenched in blood.
The sufferings of his people were atrocious. Pope lived under a
vastly superior constitution, which he believed was corruptly administered,
and the detriment to the public should have been greater,
on his principle, than the despotism of feudal times. The fact was
signally the other way. The mediæval enormities were no longer
possible; person and property were safe, and loyal citizens lived in
peace and security. Laws were not always just, religious and civil
liberty was incomplete, purity in ministers and legislators was often
defective. But there was a limit to corruption, or ministers and
legislators would have been indignantly discarded. They were compelled
in the main to consult the supposed interests of the country,
that they might preserve the power to gratify their private aims.
Many of the evils which existed kept their ground through remaining
imperfections in the constitution. The popular element was too
restricted, and the abuses were diminished when the form of government
was improved.</p>

<p>Pope's receipt for putting an end to political rancour was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the public should accept his assurance that only fools troubled their
heads about forms of government. His remedy for religious discord
was that the world should receive his dictum that only bad men
could attach importance to religious beliefs:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His can't be wrong whose life is in the right.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Since no one, he says, can have a wrong faith whose life is in the
right, all who fight for modes of faith must be graceless zealots.
Two conclusions are involved in his principle,&mdash;the first, that religious
belief and worship are not any necessary part of a life in the right;
the second, that the mode of faith has not the faintest influence upon
moral practice. Without stopping to consider the first point, we
have only to glance at the history of christianity for a decisive refutation
of the second. Thousands upon thousands of "graceless
zealots" contended, at the cost of their lives, for a mode of faith
which changed the face of the world. Pope must have argued that
the effect would have been equal, nay, superior, if christian ethics
had been divorced from christian theology. Apostles and martyrs,
then martyrs no more, should have said to pagans, "Accept our
moral precepts, and it matters not whether you believe that there is
one god, or many gods, or no god. It does not signify whether you
believe that the divine nature, and divine mission of Jesus Christ,
was a truth or a pretence, his resurrection a fact or a fable. It does
not even signify whether you believe that there is any resurrection
at all, whether you are convinced that there is an everlasting reward
for the righteous, or are persuaded that wicked and righteous will
both be annihilated. These are only 'modes of faith' which do not
affect morality, and we should be 'graceless zealots' to insist upon
them." Pope produces an additional reason in support of his principle.
"The world," he says, "will disagree in their religious hopes
and faith, but charity is the concern of everybody. Everything
which thwarts this charity must be false, and all things must be of
God which bless or mend mankind."<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Consequently, Pope's idea of
charity was never to struggle for a doctrine which would provoke
disagreement; and whoever roused opposition by warring against
ignorance and error, proclaimed himself a false teacher by his very
zeal to disseminate the truth. The christian who exposed polytheism
could not be a minister of God, nor could any doctrine "bless and
mend" heathens which did not leave their idolatrous superstitions
undisturbed. The principle cannot be limited to religion. The
world disagree in their conceptions of a "life in the right;" the
charity which is "all mankind's concern," would be violated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
questioning the lax ideas which abound; and the moralists who
"fight" for a pure system of ethics, must be classed, in turn, with
"graceless zealots." The triumph of Pope's system would be the
destruction of morality, religion, and charity; for religion and morality
must be dead already when it is acknowledged that zeal for
their purity and propagation is a sin, and the check of religion and
morality being withdrawn, the charity which remained would be that
of the savage and felon.</p>

<p>Pope set at nought his own maxims. In the name of charity he
demanded that men should not contend for their faith, and he declined
to exercise the charity he enjoined. Everyone with him was
a "graceless zealot" who ventured to dissent from his private decree.
This decree, which was to bind the rest of the world, was not to bind
Bolingbroke and himself. They were both privileged to "fight for
modes of faith." Bolingbroke, a scurrilous deist, whose writings are
stuffed with frenzied invectives against the religious "faith and
hope" of the vast majority of the English people, and who was the
true type, in the worst sense, of a "graceless zealot," is lauded by
Pope to the skies for his philosophic wisdom. Pope, on his own part,
maintained in the Essay a controversial discussion on the origin of
evil, and other mysterious topics, which most of the "zealots" he
upbraided were content to leave undetermined. He laid down the
law with dictatorial self-sufficiency, treated the difficulties of humbler
inquirers with scorn, and denounced, in taunting, contumelious language,
the impugners of the government of God. He offered no
reason for excepting the deistical "mode of faith" from his law,
unless we suppose him to have tacitly relied on his assertion that
those who shared his deism were "slaves to no sect, took no private
road, but looked through Nature up to Nature's God."<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> The plea
avails nothing. All who are honest in their opinions believe that
they hold the truth, and that they are not bigoted slaves to private
delusions. Few men could urge the claim with less plausibility than
Pope. His tenets discredited his pretensions. If he looked up to
Nature's God, he, nevertheless, stigmatised those who presumed to
study the God they adored. He believed that God infused wicked
passions into men, that his physical laws were deteriorated by change,
and overruled by chance.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> He held that the same wicked passions
which God poured into the human mind were originally generated
by animal food; his theory of morals was licentious and contradictory;
his opinions in general incoherent and irreconcileable. He
had little cause to boast that he "took no private road" when
there probably did not live a second person who would have subscribed
to his creed.</p>

<p>The fourth epistle treats of Happiness, and was a supplement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
imposed on the poet by Bolingbroke. The professed object was to refute
the atheist, who maintained that the condition of mankind was
not regulated by the rules of justice, and thence inferred that there
could be no superintending Providence. The real intention of the
"guide, philosopher, and friend" was to deprive divines of the argument
for the immortality of the soul which they built upon the want
of proportion between men's conduct and happiness. Pope was
partly the dupe of Bolingbroke, and partly his accomplice. He may
not have seen the full scope of his instructor's lessons, but he knew
that they favoured annihilation, and, to please "the master of the
poet and the song," the poet forbore to assert the opposite belief.
His orthodox friends complained of the omission, and Pope was
driven to deny that there was any connection between the purpose of
his Essay and the doctrine of a future state. After mentioning to
Spence that he had omitted the address to our Saviour by the advice
of Berkeley, he added, "One of our priests, who are more narrow-minded
than yours, made a less sensible objection to the epistle on
Happiness. He was very angry that there was nothing said in it of
our eternal happiness hereafter, though my subject was expressly to
treat only of the state of man here."<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> He subsequently extended the
remark to the entire poem. "Some wonder why I did not take in
the fall of man in my Essay, and others how the immortality of the
soul came to be omitted. The reason is plain: they both lay out of
my subject, which was only to consider man as he is in his present
state, not in his past or future."<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> When Pope told Spence that he
could not discuss the fall of man in his Essay, because the "past
state" of man was foreign to his subject, he had forgotten the contents
of his third epistle, which treats of primitive man, the age of
innocence, and the depravation of mankind through eating meat.
When he said that a future state "lay out of his subject," he did not
perceive the true bearings of his promise to "vindicate the ways of
God to man,"<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> nor the force of his own admission that to pronounce
upon the fitness of man's nature, to judge "the perfection or imperfection
of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what
relation it is placed in, and what is the proper end and purpose of its
being."<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> This is the language of common sense. Man's condition
on earth is adapted to his destiny, which can alone explain and
justify his position in the world. The justice and goodness of the
Deity wear a totally different aspect according as we discover evidence
that life is a discipline for immortality, or a sorrowful transit to
annihilation. The first epistle, again, is on the "nature and state
of man with respect to the universe;" and in this relation of man to
the universe, the one inquiry which gives importance to the rest, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
whether we are to have a share in the eternal system of things, or
whether, as the poet says of vegetables, we are mere "bubbles which
rise from the sea of matter, break, and return to it."<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The destiny
of man was at the root of Pope's subject, and he could not have
thought otherwise unless he had been bent upon accommodating his
philosophy to the infidelity of Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>The weak attempt to use language which would fit both infidelity
and belief, led to sorry conclusions. Pope allowed that it was God
who instilled into man a hope of immortality, with the object of
soothing him during his earthly career; but the poet was careful to
employ expressions which implied that the hope might be a delusion.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
He thus vindicated the ways of God by acknowledging that the
Creator of the universe might be a deceiver. As the hope, which he
confessed to be a promise engraved on the heart of man by the finger
of God, might be false, the fears of future punishment imprinted on
the conscience could not be more trustworthy. The christian who
died, exulting, at the stake, in the flower of his age, a martyr to
conscience, and the miscreant, who went terrified to execution, oppressed
by the sense of his crimes, might both be mocked by the lying
voice which spoke through the nature bestowed on them by their
Maker. The poet could see no objection to the supposition that the
Governor of the world might rule by promises he never intended to
keep, and by threats he never intended to enforce.</p>

<p>The more we look into the nature which the Deity has conferred
upon man, the more untenable Pope's alternative appears. All our
best aims,&mdash;the efforts after holiness, love, knowledge, and rational
happiness,&mdash;are a progressive work in which the mind is increasingly
fitted for the enjoyment of its aspirations, without once attaining to
a satisfactory realisation of its desires. Especially the Deity is
hidden from our sight; and devout souls would be baulked of the
primary purpose of their existence unless they were to behold him at
last. The legitimate deduction is strengthened when we consider the
afflictive methods by which we advance towards the appointed ends
of our being. The toils of virtuous men, their pangs of body, their
anguish of mind, their sacrifices to duty, their heroic martyrdoms,
are irreconcileable with the wisdom and goodness of the Deity if
total extinction is the meed of victory to the suffering soldier. The
painful education of the soul, which is unintelligible as an abortive
preliminary to annihilation, becomes plain as a preparation to a
higher state, in which the purified spirit enters upon the enjoyment
of its regenerated faculties. Pope disregarded the fundamental principle
of his Essay. The burthen of his argument in his first epistle
is that the evils of the world are explained by the hypothesis that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
they have an ulterior end. The moral life of man is the sphere in
which we can best perceive the necessity for the principle, and follow
its wise operation; and it was just this instance of a clear exemplification
of his law which Pope was willing to reject. He admitted
that the life of the saint upon earth might require no sequel, that his
brief and self-denying history might properly begin and end with his
passage from the cradle to the grave, that his implanted hopes and
fears might be a deception, the objects proposed to his faculties a vain
enticement, his sufferings a fruitless discipline, his conquest over sin
a barren triumph, his growth in holiness the signal for resolving him
into dust.</p>

<p>These considerations are not affected by the question of the distribution
of happiness. Rewards and punishments might be meted out
with an even hand, and this life singly would still be quite incompetent
to fulfil the conditions of man's nature. But the pretext of
Bolingbroke is itself unfounded, and he yielded to the exigencies of
his infidelity when he maintained that the world had never furnished
examples of unequal happiness which could call for future redress.
Pope's efforts to prove the paradox are a continuous series of contradictions,
sophistries, and misstatements. "Virtue alone," he says,
"is happiness below," and "God intends happiness to be equal."<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
It follows, from these premises, that Pope did not mean that all the
world were equally happy. Happiness he holds to be proportioned
to virtue; the best men are the richest in earthly felicity. The
supposition is repugnant to innumerable appearances, and Pope
endeavoured to evade them by contending that happiness is not
placed in "externals."<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> "Virtue's prize," he says, "is the soul's
calm sunshine which nothing can destroy;" and he justly calls men
"weak and foolish" who imagine that a better reward would be "a
crown, a coach-and-six, a conqueror's sword," or the gown which is
the badge of official dignity.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> The fallacy is upon the surface. "The
soul's calm sunshine" may mean peace of conscience or complete
felicity. In the first sense it cannot be "destroyed" by physical
torture; in the second sense, physical torture overclouds the "sunshine"
and disturbs the "calm." It is vain to pretend that a
virtuous man upon the rack has the same amount of mental ease as
when he is in bodily comfort. "Externals" are one element in
human happiness, or the worst persecutions which have desolated the
world could not have occasioned the smallest exceptional sufferings
to the good. "If pain," says Mackintosh, "were not an evil, cruelty
would not be a vice."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Pope, in his luxurious retirement at Twickenham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
might exclaim, "Condition, circumstance, is not the thing."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>
He would have thought differently if he had been the slave of a
brutal master, or had been immured in one of the dungeons called
"little-ease," where a prisoner of stout frame and sturdy principles
was sometimes maimed in the process of squeezing him into a space
too small for his coffin.</p>

<p>Pope's reason for his opinion is weaker than the opinion itself.
"Present ill," he says, "is not a curse, nor present joy a good,"
since joy and misery depend on our "future views of better or worse,"
and "the balance of happiness" is kept even while the seemingly
fortunate are "placed in fear," and the unfortunate in "hope."<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
"Pope's sylphs," remarked Fox to Rogers, "are the prettiest invention
in the world. He failed most, I think, in sense; he seldom
knew what he meant to say."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> Here we have an instance of the
failing. His proposition is that present happiness is independent of
"externals," and his argument asserts that it is not. If "fortune's
gifts" invariably fill the virtuous with "fear," and unfortunate circumstances
buoy them up with "hope," if happiness depends exclusively
on "future views of better," and misery on apprehensions of
"worse," it follows that virtue imprisoned and persecuted is "in
joy," and when free and prosperous is distressed. "Externals" are
not, as Pope pretends, indifferent; he has merely transferred the
preponderating weight to the opposite scale. Adversity is a more
exhilarating state than prosperity; the inmate of "little-ease" was
happier than his brethren of kindred virtue who were at large.
Rewards and punishments should be interchanged. Criminals should
be condemned to a life of luxury, and public benefactors should be
sent to jail. The feelings Pope ascribed to the human mind are
fictitious. Fear of reverses which do not appear to be impending,
has little influence in marring enjoyment, and hope alleviates torments
without depriving them of their sting.</p>

<p>The poet proceeds to unfold more particularly "what the happiness
of individuals is, as far as is consistent with the constitution
of this world."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> All the good that God meant for mankind,
"all the joys of sense, all the pleasures of reason, lie in three
words,&mdash;health, peace, and competence."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> The passage was versified
from Bolingbroke, who for "health" has "health of body," for
"peace" has "tranquillity of mind," and for "competence" has
"competency of wealth."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> Social intercourse and liberty must be
added to the list, or "all the joys of sense," and all "the pleasures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
of reason" are compatible with solitary confinement. Pope flings
aside his previous doctrines. Four lines earlier every individual who
had the misfortune to possess "all the joys of sense" was the slave
of fear. Now these accompaniments are pronounced essential to
happiness. Lately happiness was independent of externals, and now
health of body and competency of wealth are declared to be indispensable.
Pope's change of front did not strengthen his position.
As health, peace, and competence are necessary to happiness they
must be constant attendants on worth, or his paradox that happiness
is proportioned to virtue falls to the ground. He accordingly affirmed,
in a suppressed couplet, that "the blessings were only denied to error,
pride, or vice," and the language in the text, to have any pertinency,
must bear the same construction. But will virtue secure health?
Yes, replies Pope, for "health consists with temperance alone,"
which, for the purpose of his argument, must mean that all the
temperate are healthy. Safe from casualties, infection, and every
other disorder, they bear about with them a charmed life, and die at
last in a good old age. The poet passes over "competence," and
in a subsequent part of his epistle allows that "virtue sometimes
starves."<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

<p>He had no sooner resolved happiness into "health, peace, and
competence," and claimed them for virtue, than he admits that vice
may be "blessed" and virtue "cursed," or afflicted. A fresh assumption
is introduced to restore the balance. "Contempt," he
says, dogs "vice;" "compassion" attends upon "virtue."<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> The
new powers are not more competent to the task assigned them than
the hope and fear he had invoked before. Men who are not truly
virtuous, and yet not infamous for vice, have frequently troops of
friends, and meet with none of the contempt which is to bring down
their happiness to the standard of their worth. Virtue, on the other
hand, instead of rousing the compassion of those who could protect it,
has, in numberless instances, provoked persecution, bonds, and death.
Where the virtue is not the cause of the misery the sufferers are
often not in contact with the compassion, or the sympathy is far
from being an equivalent for the sorrow. Heaping fallacy upon
fallacy Pope falls back upon the plea that "virtue disdains the advantages
of prosperous vice."<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> Disdains the vicious means but constantly
longs for the prosperous end. The martyr to conscience
when shut up in "little-ease" was not indifferent to liberty. His
compressed body, his cramped limbs, the deprivation of light, fresh
air, books, and friends were horrible torture. There could be no
stronger proof that happiness was not proportioned to virtue than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
that his "disdain of vice" should have compelled him to accept the
alternative of a dungeon.</p>

<p>Hitherto Pope has argued that our virtue is the measure of our
happiness. He next descends to the subsidiary proposition that "no
man is unhappy through virtue," which means that the disasters of
the virtuous are never the consequences of their virtue; they are the
"ills and accidents that chance to all."<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> The proposition contains
two assertions,&mdash;the first that virtue never brings upon us "ills and
accidents," the second that it cannot protect us from them. Under
the first head Pope points to the heroes who perished fighting for
their country, and tells us that they did not meet their fate from
"virtue," but from "contempt of life."<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> The martyrs to conscience
may be reckoned by hundreds of thousands, and Pope would have us
understand that none of them braved death in obedience to duty;
they were simply weary of existence. He would deprive humanity
of its noblest triumphs that virtue may be absolved from its manifest
effects. He glides lightly over the absurd pretence that virtue
has never entailed suffering, and dwells upon the second half of his
proposition,&mdash;his admission that virtuous and wicked are equally
exposed to "ills and accidents." Good and bad men, he says, are
alike subjected to the laws of nature, and God will not "reverse
these laws for his favourites." A falling wall crushes passengers
without regard to virtue or vice;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> blind forces take no cognisance
of morality. The doctrine is inadmissible; the laws of nature cannot
supersede the providence of God. Man's welfare and very existence
are at the mercy of many human and material agencies which
man is unable to anticipate or control. The Almighty preserves a
glorious order in his physical laws, and it is incredible that he should
permit a chaos in the highest department of our globe. He would
not guard against irregularities in the action of insensate matter,
and allow good men to be the sport of the endless hazards of life.
The conclusions of reason are confirmed by revelation. "Are not
two sparrows," says our Lord, "sold for a farthing, and one of them
shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very
hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are
of more value than many sparrows."<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> He who sees from the beginning
the entire chain of causes and effects, can devise laws which
will provide for particular cases without any subsequent interference.
Or a man may be protected from a falling wall by a sudden impulse
to his mind whereby he may forget to go, or have a motive to
loiter, or to hasten forward, or to take another road.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Or there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
may be a temporary interference with mechanical laws; or the Almighty
may use methods inconceivable by us. Not that his superintendence
implies that his servants are safe from any of the ordinary
operations of natural laws. Habitually to exempt the good would
be to abolish prudence in their dealings with physical forces, and to
engender presumption in the region of morals. The insecurity which
keeps virtue vigilant and faithful, the hardy discipline which draws
out ennobling energies, and corrects baser properties, would be turned
to carelessness and corruption. The interests of the virtuous will
not permit that they should be constant and conspicuous exceptions
to the common lot. But the "ills and accidents" never strike at
random. The human race is not with the Deity an abstract conception.
He beholds every creature in its individuality, and shields
and chastens each by the rules of a wisdom which can never be
suspended. The idea we frame of his attributes negatives the hypothesis
of Pope. God cannot fail to establish a harmony between physical
laws, and the dispensation which befits each particular man.</p>

<p>In admitting that calamities befall mankind without reference to
virtue and vice, Pope was drawn into statements which completely
upset his principle that happiness is always proportioned to
desert. He asks if virtue "made Digby, the son, expire,
why his father lives full of days and honour?"<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> He might be
asked in turn, why, if good men in this life have an equal share
of happiness, the father should have lived fifty years longer than
the son? For happiness to be equal there must be an equality of
duration as well as of degree. He grants that "virtue sometimes
starves," and thinks it enough to answer, in the face of historical
facts, that virtue does not occasion the destitution. "Bread," he
says, "is the price of toil, not of virtue, and the good man may be
weak, be indolent."<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> Indolence is a vice, and irrelevant to the
discussion. The weakness may be a misfortune, and Lazarus is not
less deserving because he is covered with sores. Or the "good
man" may be neither "indolent" nor "weak," and yet be starved,
which happened to thousands of protestants who were driven from
their homes and employments by the callous bigotry of Louis XIV.
Whatever the cause of the starvation, the balance of happiness is
disturbed, and Pope, to mask the flaw in his argument, added that
the "claim" of starving virtue was not "to plenty, but content."<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>
Now contentment is of two kinds. There is a contentment of happiness
which is incompatible with excessive suffering, and a contentment
of resignation which acquiesces in the severest dispensations
of Providence. St. Paul said in the latter sense, "I have learned
in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content,"<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> which does not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
prevent his speaking repeatedly of the afflictions he endured, or keep
him from asserting that "no chastening for the present seemeth to
be joyous, but grievous."<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> Of this type is the contentment of
starving virtue,&mdash;a patient submission to trial, and not the contentment
which is required to produce equality of happiness. Human
nature has been denied the capacity for neutralising all degrees of
anguish. Pope straightway slides off into the subterfuge that the
craving for bread is "a demand for riches." He inveighs against
the rapacious desire, and insists that nothing will satisfy man.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
He undertook to prove that happiness is proportioned to virtue, and
finding his text too hard for him he substitutes an invective against
insane discontent.</p>

<p>A few undoubted truths are appended to the main argument of
Pope. He says that only a fool will think a man with health, and
a clear conscience, hated by God because he lacks a thousand a
year.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> He tells us that genuine honour and shame are dependent
on conduct, and not on high or low station,<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> and that titles, power,
fame, etc., are insufficient to make bad men happy.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> He comes to
the instance of "superior parts," and the inconsistency recommences.
He supposes the great intellect to be combined with learning, wisdom,
and patriotic virtue.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Out of compliment to his "guide, philosopher,
and friend," Pope takes Bolingbroke for the typical example of this
imposing union of lofty qualities. In him we are to behold the
universal fate of generous, philanthropic wisdom. He "is condemned
to drudge in business or in arts" without any one to
"second" him, or "judge" him rightly. He aspires "to teach
truths, and save a sinking land; few understand, all fear, and none
aid him." When he "drudged in arts" the world received coldly
his wordy rhetoric. When he "drudged in business" the country
only saw in him an intriguer for power. Novel ideas in politics,
signal originality in literature, often work their way slowly. Genius
and patriotism have faith in their conceptions, and are not daunted
by opposition. The public spirit which has to battle at all can
seldom be placed under softer conditions than Bolingbroke enjoyed.
He had every luxury of a civilised age; he had health and energy;
he had unbroken leisure; he had books at will; he had freedom to
say and write what he pleased; he was safe from every injury to
person and property. Virtuous patriotism, sitting at ease in a delightful
library, and surrounded by blessings, might be expected to
exert itself with cheerful hope to enlighten a tasteless and misguided
nation. Quite the reverse. "Painful pre-eminence!" exclaims
Pope, and he declares that Bolingbroke by being "above life's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
weakness" is above "its comforts too." The moral is that wisdom
is not to be desired; the pain exceeds the benefit. Happiness is
proportioned to virtue under the worst conditions of brutal persecution,
and yet wise and virtuous patriots, in the midst of the comforts
of life, are deprived of every comfort in life by the lamentable circumstance
that they are "above life's weakness."</p>

<p>There are many more contradictions in Pope's epistle, which is a
tissue of inconsistency and incoherence. He might have maintained
a less absolute doctrine with complete success. He might have
shown that the inequalities are less than they appear on a superficial
view. He might have pointed out that ultimate happiness can only
arise from the conduct which puts us at peace with ourselves and
with God. He might have dwelt on the satisfaction which lifts up
the mind when conscience asserts its majesty, and refuses to make
the least concession to suffering. The remaining disproportion between
happiness and virtue is vindicated by the moral blessing of
affliction, which by fitting man for happiness prepares the way for
perfect harmony between happiness and virtue in a blessed immortality.
Trials, in the magnificent phrase of Shakespeare, are "our
outward consciences."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> The pains of the last sickness which precedes
death are the consistent termination to the scheme. Good men
die as they have lived, in more or less suffering, that the work of life
may be completed,&mdash;that their better qualities may be developed and
strengthened, the remains of evil laid bare and extinguished. And
though all men are not submitted to the same tests either in their
lives or their deaths, the endless variety in their dispositions accounts
for the diversity in their circumstances. The Almighty Being who
alone knows the secrets of the heart adapts the "outward conscience"
to the inward.</p>

<p>There is a weightier question than the distribution of happiness.
Of the innumerable discussions on the theory of morals by far the
most important is whether the end we propose to ourselves should be
self-interest or virtue. Pope adopted the selfish system without
reserve. The two principles, he says, which govern man, "self-love
and reason, aspire to one end, pleasure," and since their end is
the same, he accused the schoolmen of being "at war about a name"
when they refused to confound them.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> He apparently had not a
suspicion that schoolmen, or any one else, had ever imagined that
reason could reveal another end to man than interest well understood.
He reverts to his selfish system in the epistle on Happiness,
and proclaims in the first line that "happiness is our being's end and
aim." Virtue, the love of God and man, are only means to promote
our individual happiness, and selfishness is, and ought to be, the
supreme end of every creature. The doctrine, as we have seen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
when discussing Pope's second epistle, contradicts the universal
human conscience. The theoretical falsehood is fruitful in disastrous
results. The moral law, the law of good in itself, is greater than the
individual, and he bows down before its inviolable sanctity, its absolute
right to dominion. He is raised above personal consequences.
He knows that the universal law of good embraces his good, and the
reflection helps to sustain him in his trials, but his main end is to
fulfil a law which is superior to his individual happiness, and which
binds him by its intrinsic sacredness, and independent authority.
He dares not overrule it by his passing inclinations, and endures all
things rather than be guilty of a sacrilegious encroachment on its
integrity. The man, on the contrary, whose one end is happiness,
and who considers virtue to be simply the means for compassing the
end, has nothing outside himself which is of the least importance to
him, except in so far as it can be made subservient to his personal
felicity. Creator and creation are only viewed as ministers to his
unmitigated selfishness. Governed by this single self-indulgent
idea, and deriving no strength from the separate supremacy of the
moral law, he is ill prepared for a life of sacrifice. He cannot forego
in the present the happiness which he conceives to be the sole end of
his being, and he prefers immediate ease to interest well-understood.
The system of Pope was the doctrine of Epicurus. He, too, taught
that pleasure was "the end and aim" of man, and virtue the only
effectual means. His followers soon disregarded the means in their
impatience to reach the end, and epicureanism became synonymous
with grovelling sensuality. In vain we oppose the selfishness of a
long-sighted prudence to the selfishness of the hour. "Prudence,"
as Kant says, only "counsels," and the steady ascendency over
temptation is reserved for the virtue which "commands." Common
language proclaims the intuitive principle of the mind. No man,
not lost to shame, could venture to say, "I must tell truth because
it is prudent;" he says, "I must be truthful because it is
right."</p>

<p>Pope had not the remotest idea that he was an epicurean. He
believed that his system of ethics, with happiness for an end and
virtue for the means, was new to philosophy, and he did not hesitate
to state that all "the learned" who preceded him had been "blind."<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
He exemplified his assertion by the instance of the epicureans and
stoics. The stoics reversed the terms of the epicurean formula;
virtue alone was their end, and happiness, the spontaneous, unsought
consequence. The real characteristics of these great rival schools were
unknown to Pope. He described them by false contrasts, and ignorantly
charged them with the folly of defining "happiness to be
happiness." Greatest wonder of all, he alleged against the epicurean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
doctrine, which was his own, that it "sunk men to beasts."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> He
would naturally expound the systems he understood the best, and
hence we may estimate the extent of his qualifications for dismissing
every previous ethical theory with compendious contempt. A sentence
from Bolingbroke bears witness to the scanty knowledge of
Pope, and discloses the source of his scorn. "I think," writes Bolingbroke,
"you are not extremely conversant in the works of Plato, and
you may suspect therefore that I aggravate the impertinence of his
doctrines."<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> The impertinent doctrines were a portion of the divine
platonic ethics, and Pope, uninstructed in the most famous systems
of the ancients, did but reiterate the superficial contempt of his
master.</p>

<p>In place of the "mad opinions" of learned moralists, Pope enjoins
us to "take nature's path,"<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> little dreaming that he was repeating
the maxim of the sects he despised. "The perfection of man," says
Diogenes Laertius, quoting Zeno, the founder of the stoic school, "is
to follow nature, and that is to live virtuously, for nature leads us to
that." All the moralists accepted nature for their oracle; but the
scholars gave different versions of her responses. Pope in his second
epistle insisted that man was too weak to interpret them. A Newton,
he said, who could "climb from art to art" would inevitably be
baffled in morals, for whatever "reason wove, passion would undo."<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
In the fourth epistle the difficulty has vanished; "all states can
reach, all heads conceive" happiness, and its parent morality;
"there needs but thinking right, and meaning well."<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> To think
rightly and do rightly, which was before impossible for even the
lords of human kind, is declared to be within easy reach of all the
world. Nature spoke with two voices to Pope, and what one voice
affirmed the other denied.</p>

<p>Able writers have sometimes ridiculed the precept, "Follow nature,"
which means the laws of human nature, not perceiving that
they were the necessary foundation of morals. "The way to be
happy," says the philosopher in Rasselas, "is to live according to
nature, in obedience to that universal, and unalterable law, with
which every heart is originally impressed." "Sir," answers the
prince, "I doubt not the truth of a position which a man so learned
has so confidently advanced. Let me only know what it is to live
according to nature." The philosopher replies in unintelligible
jargon, and Johnson adds, "The prince soon found that this was
one of the sages whom he should understand less as he heard him
longer."<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> The unreflecting disdain shows poorly by the side of
Butler's comment on the maxim. "The ancient moralists," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
said, "had some inward feeling or other, which they chose to express
in this manner, that man is born to virtue, that it consists in following
nature, and that vice is more contrary to this nature than tortures
or death. They had a perception that injustice was contrary
to their nature, and that pain was so also. They observed these
two perceptions totally different, not in degree, but in kind, and the
reflecting upon each of them, as they thus stood in their nature,
wrought a full intuitive conviction that more was due, and of right
belonged to one of these inward perceptions than to the other; that
it demanded in all cases to govern such a creature as man."<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> Apart
from revelation we can have no other knowledge of morality than
nature affords. Honestly interrogated nature does not put us off
with unmeaning ambiguities. As we learn through our appetites
that we are intended to eat and drink, so a higher faculty informs us
that we are to govern our appetites, and the whole of our being, by
the supreme principles we call duty. Every time we have a consciousness
that our conduct is right or wrong, every time we condemn
or applaud the vice and virtue of our fellow men, every time the law
enforces justice and punishes injustice, we confess that duty is in
accordance with nature. The precept, "follow nature," is the
rational injunction to contemplate virtue in its inner source that
we may see it in its purity, and recognise its right to supremacy.
If Pope had kept to the precept, and remembered that for parents
intentionally to train up children in iniquity is the height of infamy,
he would hardly have imagined that "the Deity poured fierce ambition
into Cæsar's mind." If he had reflected that we condemn follies
and vanities, he would not have supposed that they were a provision
of the Deity for our comfort. If he had consulted conscience, and
noticed that it instructs us to love good in itself as well as our own
good, to love God and our neighbour as an end as well as a means,
he would not have taught that the motive to virtue was unmingled
selfishness. If he had been at the trouble to remark that duty
takes in the whole circle of existence, and imposes immutable laws,
he would not have embraced the doctrine that moral government was
carried on by ruling passions which set up different principles of
action in different individuals, and in every instance narrow life to
an exclusive, and usually vicious propensity. The observation of
nature would have saved Pope from these, and many other errors,
which were the consequence of his piecing together bits of theories
from books without submitting them to the test he recommended to
his readers.</p>

<p>The deepest ethical thinkers have seldom, in all things, been faithful
interpreters of nature. Their errors, often momentous, had a
different origin from those of Pope. Few persons trace back moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
impressions to the principles from which they flow. They act on the
intuitive conceptions which precede philosophy, and which, not being
pared and twisted to fit a theory, are as comprehensive as nature.
The philosopher classifies the implanted propensities and convictions,
describes them with precision, and brings them into stronger relief.
But what he gains in distinctness he is apt to lose in breadth; he
curtails while he elucidates. His ambition is to discover simplicity
in complexity, unity in variety, and he dismembers nature that he
may reduce the phenomena within the limits of a general law. Zeno
and Epicurus are examples of the tendency. They agreed that man
had properly only a single end to which his whole being should be
directed. The epicureans said that this end, or chief good, was
pleasure, which depends on personal feeling; the stoic said it was
virtue, the submission to the universal rule of right, which is above
personal preferences. An ordinary mortal who does not philosophise,
and has no care to force nature into the mould of an hypothesis,
never questions that he is constituted for the double end of happiness
and virtue. The two often clash, and he is not perplexed by the
impossibility of satisfying both. When one must yield he knows
that virtue is paramount, and he usually believes that the present
sacrifice of happiness to virtue will be succeeded by a kingdom in
which they will be finally reconciled. The partial doctrine set up by
the stoic kept virtue on her high, heroic throne; the doctrine of the
epicurean degraded her into the slave of pleasure: the first school
ennobled, the second debased human nature, but both mutilated it.
Each system came into contact with facts which compelled its adherents
to be inconsistent or absurd, and enlightened disciples preferred
inconsistency to absurdity. This passion for general laws at
the expense of truth is conspicuous throughout the whole history of
philosophy. The profoundest investigators have been prone to select
single aspects of many-sided nature, and make the part the law for
the whole. The false generalisation impels the theorist to suppress
and distort refractory phenomena, or he endeavours to hide under
transparent evasions his deviations from his hypothesis, or he lapses
into contradictions from which he turns away his eyes, not wishing
to perceive them. The spurious unity, which is the infirmity of
philosophers, was not the vice of Pope. He adopted, on the contrary,
a chaos of principles which were mutually destructive. He
accepted contributions from any school, because he understood none.
He was so unversed in philosophy that in the account which he drew
up of his "Design," he asserted that the science of human nature
was reduced to "a few clear points," and that the "disputes" were
all on the details. His "design" was to keep to the "few clear
points" which alone, in his opinion, were of much importance to
mankind. They were principally the origin of evil, the theory of
morals, the origin of government and society. The "clear points"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
had produced whole libraries of controversy, the "disputes" had
descended in full vigour to Pope's day, and they have continued
undiminished on to ours. His own solutions of the problems were
contradictory, and he was hopelessly at war with himself on the very
topics for which he claimed universal peace. He did not depart in
his "Design" from his habit of self-contradiction, and the moment
he had stated that there were no disputes on the general principles,
he took credit for "steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly
opposite." He at the same time arrogated for his "system of
ethics" the special "merit" that it was "not inconsistent." He
had just enough knowledge to seduce him into an unconscious
exposure of his ignorance. His delusions are intelligible when we
learn the nature of his philosophical training. "I write to you, and
for you," says Bolingbroke, "and you would think yourself little
obliged to me if I took the pains of explaining in prose what you
would not think it necessary to explain in verse, and in the character
of a poetical philosopher who may dwell in generalities."<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Bolingbroke
wrote to instruct Pope, and Pope only cared to learn the
"generalities" he was to put into verse. He never acquired the
elements of philosophy; he had merely been furnished with materials
for a philosophical poem. The few ideas he gleaned at random from
other sources served no better end than to increase the confusion.
He said "he chose verse" because it was more concise and impressive
than prose.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> The alleged choice was necessity. His meagre
knowledge would have been ludicrous in a formal treatise. The
ceremonious robe of verse was essential to conceal the deformed and
diminutive body.</p>

<p>De Quincey thought that the "formal exposure of Pope's hollow-heartedness"
would be most profitably accomplished by laying open
thoroughly the ethical argument of the Essay on Man. He declined
the task as too long and polemical for an article in a journal, but he
stated his views in general terms. He said that the poem "sinned
chiefly by want of central principle, and by want therefore of all
coherency amongst the separate thoughts." He objects that the
sense will vary with the nature of the connecting links we supply,
and he ascribes the opposite interpretations of Crousaz and Warburton
to the ambiguity which leaves readers the choice of "a loyal
or treasonable meaning."<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> He imputes the fault to the impossibility
of completing the argument without spoiling the poetry, and to the
superficial nature of Pope's studies, "if study we can call a style of
reading so desultory as his." This vagrant habit of mind he attributes
to "luxurious indolence." "The poet," he says, "fastidiously
retreated from all that threatened labour.
 He fluttered among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
flower-beds of literature or philosophy far more in the character of a
libertine butterfly for casual enjoyment, than of a hard-working bee
pursuing a premeditated purpose."<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> Indolence cannot justly be
charged upon Pope. He plodded at his art with the steadiness of a
man who follows a regular calling.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> His ignorance of philosophy,
his want of due preparation for his Essay, arose from defects of
understanding, and not from a moral infirmity of will. He was
self-educated, and had never penetrated in his youth by regular and
sustained approaches to the heart of any difficult science. He
skimmed literature to pick up sentiments which could be versified,
and to learn attractive forms of composition. His mind took the set
of his early habits, and he appears in manhood to have had no conception
of philosophical thought, no glimmer of the combination of
philosophical details into an integral design. His works abound in
isolated ideas which are marked by sound sense, and side by side
with them are many idle or extravagant notions, and glaring contradictions.
The pieces were not struck off at a heat. They were
built up slowly, composed patiently, and corrected repeatedly. He
never spared pains, and the want of reflection his works discover was
the fault of an intellect unconscious of its weaknesses. To him the
disjointed bits of philosophy presented no gaps. He says in his
"Design" that the system "was short yet not imperfect." He
believed that the conciseness added to "the force as well as grace of
his arguments," and that he had nowhere "sacrificed perspicuity
to ornament, wandered from precision, or broken the chain of the
reasoning." His love of fame would have prevented his sending
forth knowingly a weak and fragmentary poem. His moral apathy
did not therefore consist in the self-indulgent negligence which
refuses to put itself to a strain. The moral offence was in another
direction,&mdash;in the ambiguities which were intended to pass off the
Essay for anti-christian with infidels, and for christian with believers,
and which resulted in Pope's adoption of the first interpretation
under Bolingbroke, and of the second under Warburton. The dereliction
of principle was worse than De Quincey supposed. He
has equally underrated the blots in the philosophy when he imagined
that Pope erred only by omissions. The "chasms" in his
ethics are trifling compared to the radical vice of his doctrines, and
the repeated conflict of jarring systems. The "audacious dogmatism
and insolent quibbles"<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> of Warburton would not have been needed
in expanding an abbreviated argument. He had to distort the obvious
meaning of Pope in order to produce a semblance of consistency,
and he has still oftener left the language of the text without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
comment because it was beyond the power of shameless misinterpretation
to effect an ostensible harmony.</p>

<p>The judgments on the Essay on Man have been very various.
"It appears to me," says Voltaire, "the most beautiful, the most
useful, the most sublime didactic poem that has ever been written in
any language." He said on another occasion that Pope "carried
the torch into the abyss of being, and that the art of poetry, sometimes
frivolous, and sometimes divine, was in him useful to the
human race."<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> Voltaire had a twofold reason for his admiration.
As a hater of christianity he hailed in the Essay the championship of
natural religion against revealed, and as an author he delighted in
the rhymed philosophy which was the staple of his own prosaic
verse. Marmontel joined in the praise of the poet, but formed a
juster estimate of the moralist. "Pope has shown," he said, "how
high poetry could soar on the wings of philosophy. But he had
adopted a system which presented terrible difficulties, and in reply to
the complaints of man on the misery of his condition he usually
offers images for proofs, and abuse for reasons."<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> The censure is
just. Pope loves to silence objections by vilifying mankind, and
calling his adversaries impious, proud, and fools. Dugald Stewart
agreed with Voltaire. "The Essay on Man," he says, "is the
noblest specimen of philosophical poetry which our language affords;
and, with the exception of a very few passages, contains a valuable
summary of all that human reason has been able hitherto to advance
in justification of the moral government of God."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> The "few faulty
passages" were subsequently specified by Stewart, and such is the
power of sound to withdraw the mind from the sense that this able
metaphysician overlooked the fundamental errors of the poem, albeit
they contradicted his own ethical views. Hazlitt differs as much
from Stewart as Marmontel did from Voltaire. "The Essay on
Man," he tells us, "is not Pope's best work. All that he says, 'the
very words and to the self-same tune,' would prove just as well that
whatever is is wrong, as that whatever is is right."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> The remark
is but a slight exaggeration of the truth. The logic of assertion, and
often of vituperative assertion, in which Pope abounded, is available
for every system, and his admission that God is the instigator of
evil was a fit foundation for a pessimist philosophy. De Quincey's
opinion is the most unfavourable of all. "If the question," he says,
"were asked, What ought to have been the best among Pope's
poems? most people would answer, the Essay on Man. If the
question were asked, What is the worst? all people of judgment
would say, the Essay on Man. Whilst yet in its rudiments this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
poem claimed the first place by the promise of its subject; when
finished, by the utter failure of its execution, it fell into the last."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>
"Execution" is used by De Quincey in its widest sense, and includes
the philosophy of the Essay. This we have endeavoured to estimate,
and have now to speak of the poetry.</p>

<p>"In my mind," says Lord Byron, writing of Pope, "the highest
of all poetry is ethical poetry, as the highest of all earthly objects
must be moral truth," and he adds that "ethical or didactic poetry
requires more mind, more wisdom, more power" than all the "descriptions"
of natural scenery that were ever penned, "and all the
epics that ever were founded upon fields of battle."<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> To the assertion
that ethical poets transcended all other poets in genius, Hazlitt
answered, that the "mind, wisdom, and power" is displayed in the
"philosophic invention," and as this "rests with the first author of
a moral truth," or moral theory, a copyist is not great because he
gives a metrical form to an ethical common-place. "The decalogue,"
he says, "as a practical prose composition, or as a body of moral laws
and precepts, is of sufficient weight and authority, but we should not
regard the putting of this into heroic verse as an effort of the highest
poetry."<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> To the assertion that ethical poetry must take precedence
of all other poetry, "because moral truth and moral conduct are
of such vast and paramount concernment in human life," Hazlitt
answered, that "it did not follow that they were the better for being
put into rhyme." "This reasoning," he continues, "reminds us of
the critic who said that the only poetry he knew of, good for anything,
was the four lines beginning 'Thirty days hath September,'
for that these were really of some use in finding out the number
of days in the different months of the year. The rules of arithmetic
are important in many respects, but we do not know that they
are the fittest subjects of poetry."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> The reply of Hazlitt is conclusive.
Lord Byron had confounded the importance of facts with
their fitness for poetry, the repetition of a truth with the genius
which discovers it. He was "in a great passion," says De Quincey,
"and wrote up Pope by way of writing down others," the others
being Wordsworth, Southey, and Coleridge.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> He had taken a false
measure of his men. They were too strong in their own poetical
convictions to be mortified by the absurdities of an intemperate rival.</p>

<p>The error of Byron was akin to the misconception of the office of
didactic poems, which De Quincey exposed in his criticism on Pope's
Essay on Man. "As a term of convenience," he says, "didactic
may serve to discriminate one class of poetry, but didactic it cannot

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
be in philosophic rigour without ceasing to be poetry." If the
object of Armstrong had been to teach Medicine, of Dyer to produce
a manual for shepherds and cloth manufacturers, of Philips
to write a treatise for gardeners and makers of cider, he maintains
that it would have been idiotcy to begin by putting on the fetters
of metre. He remarks that a worse restriction is the necessity
of omitting a vast variety of details, and capital sections of
the subject, and that in the constant need to forego either
poetry or instruction the poet never hesitates to abandon the
instruction. The true object, he conceives, of a didactic poem is
to bring out the "circumstances of beautiful form, feeling, incident,
or any other interest" which lurk in didactic topics. The
sentiment which the tutor neglects the poet evolves, and he introduces
utilitarian knowledge for the sole purpose of eliciting an element
distinct from its bare, prosaic utility.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> This is the rational
theory. In Pope's generation, and for some years afterwards, a
different idea was widely prevalent. "The end of the didactic
poem," says Marmontel, "is to instruct. It were to be wished that
the principles of the most important arts should all be reduced to
verse. It is thus that at the birth of letters all useful truths were
consigned to memory. To bring back the didactic poem to its primitive
utility ought to be the object of emulation to the poets of an age
of light."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> The system which Marmontel recommended for an age
of light was only fitted for an age of darkness. The utility of
a didactic work depends on its lucidity, its precision, and its fullness.
The use is defeated if the instruction is fragmentary, incoherent,
circuitous, and cumbrous. When men emerge from ignorance, and
when knowledge begins to grow systematic and exact, the employment
of verse for expounding arts, sciences, philosophy, and history
becomes puerile and impotent. The moment they are brought under
the dominion of the enlightened understanding the freedom of prose
is essential to unfold them with clearness, completeness, and accuracy.
The suggestion of Marmontel for restoring didactic poetry to its
primitive use was the way to reduce it to imbecility. The events of
English history are of greater moment than the cutting off Miss
Fermor's curl, and an English history in verse would be "higher
poetry" according to Byron, more "useful poetry" according to
Marmontel, than the Rape of the Lock. In reality it would not be
high or useful, poetry or history, but simply a folly. The didactic
poets who had a truer comprehension of the nature of poetry, and
who endeavoured to render the rules of an art or science subservient
to poetic effect, have seldom succeeded. The inherent, prosaic element
preponderated, and the Arts of Poetry, Criticism, Translating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Verse, etc. are for the most part dreary compositions which afford as
little delight as instruction.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke had right conceptions of the characteristics of didactic
poetry, and he imparted his views to Pope. "Should the poet," he
says, "make syllogisms in verse, or pursue a long process of reasoning
in the didactic style, he would be sure to tire his reader on the
whole, like Lucretius, though he reasoned better than the Roman,
and put into some parts of his work the same poetical fire. He
must contract, he may shadow, he has a right to omit whatever will
not be cast in the poetic mould, and when he cannot instruct he may
hope to please. In short, it seems to me, that the business of the
philosopher is to dilate, to press, to prove, to convince, and that of
the poet to hint, to touch his subject with short and spirited strokes,
to warm the affections, and to speak to the heart."<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> Bolingbroke's
theory of poetry was superior to his practical taste. He said that
all Pope's writings were pre-eminent for "the happy association of
great coolness of judgment with great heat of imagination." "Pope's
Essay on Criticism," he says again, "was the work of his childhood
almost; but is such a monument of good sense and poetry as no
other, that I know, has raised in his riper years."<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> The man who
could discover transcendent poetry in the Essay on Criticism, and
great heat of imagination in all Pope's writings, could have had but
a faint, diluted perception of the imaginative and poetic. His belief
that the ethical philosophy of the Essay on Man could be brought
under his law of didactic poetry was a fresh instance of his want of
insight into the demands both of poetry and philosophy. A system
of philosophy cannot be conveyed in elegant extracts. "Every
part," says de Quincey, "depends upon every other part: in such
a nexus of truths, to insulate is to annihilate. Severed from each
other the parts lose their support, their coherence, their very meaning;
you have no liberty to reject or choose." It was not enough
for Pope to detail his system. He had to vindicate, and establish
it. "In his theme," continues De Quincey, "everything is polemic;
you move only through dispute, you prosper only by argument and
never-ending controversy. There is not positively one capital proposition
or doctrine about man, about his origin, his nature, his
relations to God, or his prospects, but must be fought for with
energy, watched at every turn with vigilance, and followed into
endless mazes, not under the choice of the writer, but under the
inexorable dictation of the argument. Here lay the impracticable
dilemma for Pope's Essay on Man. To satisfy the demands of the
subject was to defeat the objects of poetry. To evade the demands
in the way that Pope has done, is to offer us a ruin for a
 palace."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>

The poetry could not escape without injury. The philosophic pretensions
Pope advanced at the outset compelled him to embark in
prosaic arguments; the philosophy and the poetry were mutually
destructive. Left to himself he would have kept to his "ethics in
the Horatian way," to the sketches of character, and reflections
upon human conduct, which constitute his Moral Essays. His
"guide" dictated to him a more ambitious philosophy,&mdash;not the
"divine philosophy which is musical as Apollo's lute,"<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> which
touches tender feelings, and appeals to the intuitive moral emotions,
but a hybrid philosophy too scholastic to move the heart, and too
meagre and perplexed to satisfy the understanding.</p>

<p>The false scheme of embodying scientific philosophy in verse determined
in advance the failure of the Essay on its poetic side.
There might be passages of good poetry, but not a good poem.
"The episodes in the Essay on Man," says Hazlitt, "the description
of the poor Indian, and the lamb doomed to death, are all the
unsophisticated reader ever remembers of that much talked of production."<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>
The remark which Hazlitt employed to condemn the
Essay, was used by Bowles in its favour. The ethics, in his eyes,
were only the groundwork for poetical embroidery. "We hardly,"
he said, "think of the philosophy, whether it is good or bad," and
he represented the reader hurried away by the finished and touching
pictures of the Indian and the lamb, which are exceptions to the
didactic tenor of the poem, and speak to the sympathies of mankind.
Hazlitt's application of the criticism was correct, and the eulogy, or
apology, put forward by Bowles, was really censure. The happy
episodes are but a fragment of the four epistles. The rest is designed
for philosophical reasoning, and if we hardly think of the philosophy,
there is little left except sound. The philosophy is not dimmed by
the blaze of poetry. There is no splendour of imagery, no brilliancy
of idea to overshadow the argument, and the sole reason the philosophy
fails to take hold of the mind is because it is vague and disconnected,
because the whole, as De Quincey says, "is the realisation
of anarchy."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> The want of philosophic unity might have
been largely compensated by the personal unity of strong conviction;
the earnest faith and feelings of the man might have stood in the
place of the scientific completeness of the subject. In nothing was
Pope more deficient. For personal convictions he substituted any
discordant notion which he fancied would look well in verse, and the
Essay is no more bound together by the pervading spirit of individual
sentiment than by logical connection. The languid inattention
which the poem invites is seen in the statement of Bowles that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
is "a nice precision in every word." No one could attempt to
get at Pope's meaning without being frequently tormented by the
difficulty, and sometimes the impossibility, of interpreting his lax,
indeterminate language. "Hardly thinking of the philosophy,"
Bowles did not observe that there was often a lamentable want of
precision in Pope's conceptions, and when these are misty and confused,
the expression of them cannot be rigorous and definite. Loose
and ambiguous phraseology was not the only fault of style. The
use of inversions, and of unlicensed, elliptical modes of speech, was a
cardinal blemish in Pope's poetry. The failing reached its height in
the Essay on Man. Many of the contortions are barbarous, and
were enough of themselves to dispel the delusion that Pope was
distinguished by correctness of composition. His grammatical faults,
when not deliberate to force a rhyme, are comparatively venial.
Such oversights are found in all authors, and proceed from inadvertence;
they are little more than clerical errors. The deformities
of vicious construction are of a different order. They arose from
defect of literary power, from the incapacity to reconcile the requirements
of verse with the rules of English. The maimed and distorted
language obscures the sense, destroys or debases the poetry, and
lessens the general impression of his genius. The Essay was altogether
a mistake. A slip from a neighbour's tree was planted in an
uncongenial soil, and the cultivation bestowed upon it produced little
more than feeble rootlets, and sickly shoots.</p>

<p>M. Taine asserts that from the Restoration to the French Revolution,
from Waller to Johnson, from Hobbes and Temple to Robertson
and Hume, all our literature, both prose and verse, bears the
impress of classic art. The mode, he says, culminated in the reign
of Queen Anne, and Pope, he considers, was the extreme example of
it. The characteristics which M. Taine ascribes to the classic era
are, in the matter, common-place truths, and, in the manner, a style
finished and artificial,&mdash;noble language, oratorical pomp, and studied
correctness. Poetry ceased to be inventive; the very composition is
uniform, and the obvious or borrowed thoughts are all cast in one
mould. Verse is nothing more than cold, rational prose, a species
of superior conversation measured off into lengths, and fringed with
rhyme; the form predominates over the matter; the ostentatious
exterior is the mask to impoverished, colourless ideas.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> The habit
of M. Taine is to generalise a partial truth into extravagance. Many
of the most eminent authors who flourished between the English
Restoration and the French Revolution wrote in a style far removed
from that which M. Taine calls classical,&mdash;in an inelegant, uncondensed
style as Locke, in a crude, clumsy style as Bishop Butler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
in a vigorous, colloquial style as Bentley, in a homely, straightforward
style as Swift, in an unpretentious, narrative style as De Foe, in
a loose, familiar style as Burnet. The verse differs like the prose,
though in a less degree, and is not "of a uniform make as if
fabricated by a machine."<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> The witty and grotesque Hudibras of
Butler, the tales, and many short poems of Prior, the humourous,
satiric verses of Swift, the Songs and Fables of Gay, the Seasons
of Thomson, the heroics of Pope, are all in dissimilar styles. Neither
is the substance of the prose and verse, from the Restoration to the
French Revolution, an invariable common-sense mediocrity. There
is a great display of genius in political philosophy and political
economy, in moral, metaphysical, and natural science, in manifold
species of satire and fiction, and, omitting Milton, who was formed
under earlier influences, in various kinds of poetry, short of the
highest. M. Taine was partly conscious of the facts, as may be seen
in his individual criticisms, which are a refutation of his general
theory. There is this much truth in his view, that there was a
growing tendency to cultivate style, and in some writers the art
degenerated into the artificial. Among the numerous varieties of
the defect one is a monotonous structure of verse and sentence,
another the attempt to disguise the commonness of the thoughts by
the elaboration of the workmanship. These are frequent faults in
the poetry of Pope, and the mannerism remains when the execution
is a failure. His style is admirable in parts, but he falls far below
Dryden in the general elasticity of his composition, in the wealth of
his language, and in the subtle intricacies of metrical harmony. His
thoughts are often gems rendered lustrous by the skill of the cutter,
but intermingling with them are counterfeit stones which impose by
their glitter on the superficial observer, and when examined are found
worthless.</p>

<p>As the epistolary way of writing hath prevailed much of

time since, and whose<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> author chose this manner, notwithstanding
his subject was high and of dignity, because of its being
mixed with argument, which of its nature approacheth to
prose. This, which we first give the reader, treats of the
nature and state of man with respect to the universal system.
The rest will treat of him with respect to his own system, as
an individual, and as a member of society, under one or other
of which heads all ethics are included.</p>

<p>Having proposed to write some pieces on human life and
manners, such as, to use my Lord Bacon's expression, come
home to men's business and bosoms, I thought it more satisfactory
to begin with considering man in the abstract, his
nature and his state; since to prove any moral duty, to
enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or
imperfection of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to
know what condition and relation it is placed in, and what is
the proper end and purpose of its being.</p>

<p>The science of human nature is, like all other sciences,
reduced to a few clear points. There are not many certain
truths in this world. It is therefore in the anatomy of the
mind as in that of the body, more good will accrue to mankind
by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts,
than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels, the
conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation.
The disputes are all upon these last, and, I will
venture to say, they have less sharpened the wits than the
hearts of men against each other, and have diminished the
practice, more than advanced the theory of morality. If I
could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit, it is in
steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite,
in passing over terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> a
temperate, yet not inconsistent, and a short, yet not imperfect,
system of ethics.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>

This I might have done in prose; but I chose verse, and
even rhyme, for two reasons. The one will appear obvious;
that principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the
reader more strongly at first, and are more easily retained by
him afterwards. The other may seem odd, but is true. I
found I could express them more shortly this way than in
prose itself; and nothing is more certain, than that much of
the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends
on their conciseness. I was unable to treat this part of my
subject more in detail, without becoming dry and tedious; or
more poetically, without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament,
without wandering from the precision, or breaking the chain
of reasoning. If any man can unite all these, without diminution
of any of them, I freely confess he will compass a
thing above my capacity.</p>

<p>What is now published, is only to be considered as a
general map of man, marking out no more than the greater
parts, their extent, their limits, and their connexion, but
leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the
charts which are to follow. Consequently, these Epistles, in
their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any progress)
will be less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament.
I am here only opening the fountains, and clearing
the passage. To deduce the rivers, to follow them in their
course, and to observe their effects, may be a task more
agreeable.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="em1point30">ARGUMENT OF EPISTLE I.</span></p>

<p class="center">OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO
THE UNIVERSE.</p>

<p>Of man in the abstract&mdash;I. That we can judge only with regard to our own
system, being ignorant of the relation of systems and things, ver. 17, &amp;c.
II. That man is not to be deemed imperfect, but a being suited to his place
and rank in the creation, agreeable to the general order of things, and conformable
to ends and relations to him unknown, ver. 35, &amp;c. III. That it is
partly upon his ignorance of future events, and partly upon the hope of a
future state, that all his happiness in the present depends, ver. 77, &amp;c.
IV. The pride of aiming at more knowledge, and pretending to more perfection,
the cause of man's error and misery. The impiety of putting himself
in the place of God, and judging of the fitness or unfitness, perfection or imperfection,
justice or injustice, of His dispensations, ver. 113, &amp;c. V. The
absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the creation, or expecting
that perfection in the moral world, which is not in the natural, ver. 131, &amp;c.
VI. The unreasonableness of his complaints against Providence, while on the
one hand he demands the perfections of the angels, and on the other the
bodily qualifications of the brutes, though, to possess any of the sensitive
faculties in a higher degree, would render him miserable, ver. 173, &amp;c. VII.
That throughout the whole visible world, an universal order and gradation in
the sensual and mental faculties is observed, which causes a subordination of
creature to creature, and of all creatures to man. The gradations of sense,
instinct, thought, reflection, reason; that reason alone countervails all the
other faculties, ver. 207. VIII. How much further this order and subordination
of living creatures may extend, above and below us; were any part of
which broken, not that part only, but the whole connected creation, must be
destroyed, ver. 233. IX. The extravagance, madness, and pride of such a
desire, ver. 259. X. The consequence of all, the absolute submission due to
Providence, both as to our present and future state, ver. 281, &amp;c., to the end.</p>

ARGUMENT OF EPISTLE II.</span></p>

<p class="center">OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO
HIMSELF, AS AN INDIVIDUAL.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I. The business of man not to pry into God, but to study himself. His
middle nature: his powers and frailties, ver. 1 to 19. The limits of his
capacity, ver. 19, &amp;c. II. The two principles of man, self-love and reason,
both necessary, ver. 53, &amp;c. Self-love the stronger, and why, ver. 67, &amp;c.
Their end the same, ver. 81, &amp;c. III. The passions, and their use, ver. 93 to
130. The predominant passion, and its force, ver. 132 to 160. Its necessity,
in directing men to different purposes, ver. 165, &amp;c. Its providential use, in
fixing our principle, and ascertaining our virtue, ver. 177. IV. Virtue and
vice joined in our mixed nature; the limits near, yet the things separate and
evident: what is the office of reason, ver. 202 to 216. V. How odious vice in
itself, and how we deceive ourselves into it, ver. 217. VI. That, however,
the ends of Providence and general good are answered in our passions and imperfections,
ver. 238, &amp;c. How usefully these are distributed to all orders of
men, ver. 241. How useful they are to society, ver. 251. And to individuals,
ver. 263. In every state, and every age of life, ver.
 273, &amp;c.</p>

ARGUMENT OF EPISTLE IV.</span></p>



<p class="center">OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO
HAPPINESS.</p>

<p>I. False notions of happiness, philosophical and popular, answered from
ver. 19 to 26. II. It is the end of all men, and attainable by all, ver. 29.
God intends happiness to be equal; and, to be so, it must be social, since all
particular happiness depends on general, and since he governs by general, not
particular laws, ver. 35. As it is necessary for order, and the peace and welfare
of society, that external goods should be unequal, happiness is not made
to consist in these, ver. 49. But notwithstanding that inequality, the balance
of happiness among mankind is kept even by Providence, by the two passions
of hope and fear, ver. 67. III. What the happiness of individuals is, as far as
is consistent with the constitution of this world; and that the good man has
here the advantage, ver. 77. The error of imputing to virtue what are only
the calamities of nature, or of fortune, ver. 93. IV. The folly of expecting
that God should alter his general laws in favour of particulars, ver. 121.
V. That we are not judges who are good; but that whoever they are, they
must be happiest, ver. 131, &amp;c. VI. That external goods are not the proper
rewards, but often inconsistent with, or destructive of virtue, ver. 167. That
even these can make no man happy without virtue: instanced in riches,
ver. 185. Honours, ver. 193. Nobility, ver. 205. Greatness, ver. 217.
Fame, ver. 237. Superior talents, ver. 259, &amp;c. With pictures of human
infelicity in men possessed of them all, ver. 269, &amp;c. VII. That virtue only
constitutes a happiness whose object is universal, and whose prospect eternal,
ver. 309. That the perfection of virtue and happiness consists in a conformity
to the order of Providence here, and a resignation to it here and hereafter,
ver. 327, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>THE UNIVERSAL PRAYER.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="em0point65"><span class="smcap">
By the Author of the "Essay on Man."</span> </span></p>

<p class="center">London: Printed for <span class="smcap">R. Dodsley</span>, at Tully's-Head, in Pall-Mall, 1738,
Price Sixpence.</p>

<p>This pamphlet, which came out in folio, and octavo, and probably in quarto,
was the only separate edition of the Universal Prayer.</p>

<p>For closeness and comprehension of thought, and for brevity and
energy of expression, few pieces of poetry in our language can be
compared with this Prayer. I am surprised Johnson should not
make any mention of it. When it was first published many orthodox
persons were, I remember, offended at it, and called it the Deist's
Prayer. It were to be wished the deists would make use of so good
a one.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>How extraordinary it is that Warton should be ever accused as
if he wished to decry Pope! No one has borne such willing and
ample testimony to his excellence as a poet, when he truly deserves
it. In this place Warton gives the poetry more praise than it appears
entitled to, though this composition is beautiful, and the two last
stanzas sublime; but I fear, if we were to examine the greater part
by the Horatian rule, which Warton recommends, that is, altering
the rhyme and measure,<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> we should not find the "disjecti membra
poetæ."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>Warburton says that "some passages in the Essay on Man having
been unjustly suspected of a tendency towards fate and naturalism,
the author composed this prayer as the sum of all, to show that his
system was founded in free-will, and terminated in piety." The
prayer was written shortly before Warburton stretched out his helping
hand to Pope, and therefore before the poet had renounced the system
and assistance of Bolingbroke, in reliance on a more serviceable
defender. He did not yet venture, as Warburton pretends, to abjure
"naturalism," but kept to it in every line, and even in the title of
his poem. A "universal" could not be a christian prayer. He
avowedly set aside the distinguishing characteristics of the gospel,
and professed to exclude all language which could not be adopted by
the votaries of "every age and clime," by "savage" as well as
"saint," by the idolaters of "Jupiter" as well as by the worshippers
of "Jehovah." No wonder that many persons in England should
have called the Universal, the Deist's Prayer, or that when translated
into French it should have gone by the title of <i>Prière du Déiste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a>
Warton "wished the deists would make use of so good a one."
There was nothing in their creed which could require them to use a
worse.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>

On the question of "free-will," Pope taught discordant doctrines.
In the Universal Prayer it is said that the "human will is left free,"
and in the Essay on Man "moral ill" is ascribed to its "wanderings."<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a>
But in other parts of the Essay we are told that Cæsar's
fierce ambition is inspired by God, and that man is born with a single
ruling passion which, do all he can, engulfs every sentiment of his
soul. Neither this, nor any other discrepancy, is cleared up in the
Universal Prayer. The contradictions are only multiplied. According
to the Prayer "nature is bound fast in fate," and according to
the Essay "nature deviates," which is asserted to account for the
"physical ill" that God does "not send."<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> The Essay teaches us
that the moral law of mankind is selfishness, and that we are to be
virtuous solely because it promotes our individual happiness. The
fourth stanza of the Prayer reverses the relation in which virtue
stands to happiness, and bids us shun evil more than hell or pain,
pursue good more than heaven or felicity. Pope's view of Providence
in the Essay is that God will not interpose to protect his
servants.<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> The Prayer contains a petition for "bread and peace,"
which is either a delusive form or a confession that the Almighty
adapts events to the pious dispositions of particular men. Reason
concurs with revelation in this conclusion. The necessary inference
from the perfection of God's attributes is that his government takes
in every circumstance, and as mind is superior to matter, physical
laws cannot be framed without a special regard to the fervent prayers
of faithful hearts.</p>

<p>The Universal Prayer failed to fulfil Pope's main design, and increased
the confusion it was meant to remove. His defective material
is cast in an unsuitable form, and, wanting to expound his
opinions, he has introduced comments which are misplaced or offensive
in a prayer. No worshipper of Jehovah would blasphemously
address him as "Jehovah or Jove," and no one, except the persons
who preach while they pray, would introduce such reflections as that
"God is paid when man receives," and that "binding nature fast
in fate he had left free the human will." The faulty conception is
not redeemed by the exquisiteness of the poetry. The composition
is tame and prosaic, and never rises above the level of a second rate
hymn.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="em1point88">ESSAY ON MAN.<a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="em1point12">COMMENTARY ON EPISTLE I.</span></h3>

<p>The opening of this Poem, in fifteen lines, is taken up in giving an account
of the subject; which, agreeably to the title, is an Essay on Man, or a philosophical
inquiry into his nature and end, his passions and pursuits. The
exordium relates to the whole work, of which the Essay on Man was only the
first book. The sixth, seventh, and eighth lines allude to the subjects of this
Essay, viz. the general order and design of Providence; the constitution of
the human mind; the origin, use, and end of the passions and affections, both
selfish and social; and the wrong pursuits of happiness in power, pleasure, &amp;c.
The tenth, eleventh, twelfth, &amp;c. have relation to the subjects of the books
intended to follow, viz. the characters and capacities of men, and the limits of
science, which once transgressed, ignorance begins, and errors without end
succeed. The thirteenth and fourteenth, to the knowledge of mankind, and
the various manners of the age.</p>

<p>The poet tells us next, line 16, with what design he wrote, viz.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
To vindicate the ways of God to man.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The men he writes against, he frequently informs us, are such as weigh their
opinions against Providence, ver. 114, such as cry, if man's unhappy, God's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
unjust, ver. 118, or such as fall into the notion, that vice and virtue there is
none at all, Epistle ii. ver. 212. This occasions the poet to divide his vindication
of the ways of God into two parts; in the first of which he gives direct
answers to those objections which libertine men, on a view of the disorders
arising from the perversity of the human will, have intended against Providence;
and in the second, he obviates all those objections, by a true delineation
of human nature, or a general, but exact, map of man. The first Epistle is
employed in the management of the first part of this dispute; and the three
following, in the discussion of the second. So that this whole book constitutes
a complete Essay on Man, written for the best purpose, to vindicate
the ways of God.</p>

<p>Ver. 17. <i>Say first, of God above, or man below, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having
declared his subject; his end of writing; and the quality of his adversaries,
proceeds, from ver. 16 to 23, to instruct us, from whence he intends to draw
his arguments; namely, from the visible things of God in this system, to
demonstrate the invisible things of God, his eternal power and godhead.
And why? Because we can reason only from what we know; and as we
know no more of man than what we see of his station here, so we know no
more of God than what we see of his dispensations in this station; being
able to trace him no further than to the limits of our own system. This
naturally leads the poet to exprobrate the miserable folly and impiety of
pretending to pry into, and call in question, the profound dispensations of
Providence: which reproof contains, from ver. 22 to 43, a sublime description
of the omniscience of God, and the miserable blindness and presumption
of man.</p>

<p>Ver. 43. <i>Of systems possible, &amp;c.</i>] So far the poet's modest and sober introduction:
in which he truly observes, that no wisdom less than omniscient</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Can tell why heav'n has made us as we are.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet though we be unable to discover the particular reasons for this mode of
our existence, we may be assured in general that it is right. For now,
entering upon his argument, he lays down this evident proposition as the
foundation of his thesis, which he reasonably supposes will be allowed him,
That, of all possible systems, infinite wisdom hath formed the best, ver. 43,
44. From whence he draws two consequences:</p>

<p>1. The first, from ver. 44 to 51, is, that as the best system cannot but be
such a one as hath no unconnected void; such a one in which there is a
perfect coherence and gradual subordination in all its parts; there must needs
be, in some part or other of the scale of reasoning life, such a creature as
man, which reduces the dispute to this absurd question, Whether God has
placed him wrong?</p>

<p>Ver. 51. <i>Respecting man, &amp;c.</i>] It being shown that man, the subject of this
inquiry, has a necessary place in such a system as this is confessed to be; and
it being evident, that the abuse of free-will, from whence proceeds all moral
evil, is the certain effect of such a creature's existence; the next question will
be, how these evils can be accounted for, consistently with the idea we have
of God's moral attributes? Therefore,</p>

<p>2. The second consequence he draws from his principle, That of all possible
systems, infinite wisdom has formed the best, is, that whatever is wrong in our
private system, is right as relative to the whole:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Respecting man, whatever wrong we call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, must be right, as relative to all.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>

That it may, he proves, from ver. 52 to 61, by showing in what consists the
difference between the systematic works of God, and those of man; viz. that,
in the latter, a thousand movements scarce gain one purpose; in the former,
one movement gains many purposes. So that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Man, who here seems principal alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And acting thus, the appearance of wrong in the partial system may be right
in the universal; for</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That it must, the whole body of this epistle is employed to illustrate and
enforce. Thus partial evil is universal good, and thus Providence is fairly
acquitted.</p>

<p>Ver. 61. <i>When the proud steed, &amp;c.</i>] From all this the poet draws a general
conclusion, from ver. 60 to 91, that, as what has been said is sufficient to
vindicate the ways of Providence, man should rest submissive and content,
and own everything to be disposed for the best; that to think of discovering
the manner how God conducts this wonderful scheme to its completion, is
as absurd as to imagine that the horse and ox shall ever be able to comprehend
why they undergo such different treatment in the hand of man:
nay, that such knowledge, if communicated, would be even pernicious, and
make us neglect or desert our duty here. This he illustrates by the case
of the lamb, which is happy in not knowing the fate that attends it from
the butcher; and from thence takes occasion to observe, that God is the equal
master of all his creatures, and provides for the proper happiness of each and
every of them.</p>

<p>Ver. 91. <i>Hope humbly then; &amp;c.</i>] But now an objector is supposed to put
in, and say, "You tell us, indeed, that all things shall terminate in good;
but we see ourselves surrounded with present evil; yet you forbid us all
inquiry into the manner how we are to be extricated from it, and, in a word,
leave us in a very disconsolate condition." Not so, replies the poet; you may
reasonably, if you please, receive much comfort from the hope of a happy
futurity; a hope implanted in the human breast by God himself for this very
purpose, as an earnest of that bliss, which, always flying from us here, is
reserved for the good man hereafter. The reason why the poet chooses to
insist on this proof of a future state, in preference to others, is in order to
give his system (which is founded in a sublime and improved Platonism) the
greater grace of uniformity. For hope was Plato's peculiar argument for a
future state; and the words here employed, The soul uneasy, &amp;c. his peculiar
expression. The poet in this place, therefore, says in express terms, that God
gave us hope to supply that future bliss, which he at present keeps hid from
us. In his second Epistle, ver. 274, he goes still further, and says, this hope
quits us not even at death, when every thing mortal drops from us:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Hope travels through, nor quits us when we die.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And in the fourth Epistle he shows how the same hope is a proof of a future
state, from the consideration of God's giving his creatures no appetite in vain,
or what he did not intend should be satisfied:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
He sees, why nature plants in man alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope of known bliss, and faith in bliss unknown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature, whose dictates to no other kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are giv'n in vain, but what they seek they find.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>

It is only for the good man, he tells us, that hope leads from goal to goal, &amp;c.
It would then be strange indeed, if it should prove an illusion.</p>

<p>Ver. 99. <i>Lo! the poor Indian, &amp;c.</i>] The poet, as we said, having bid man
comfort himself with expectation of future happiness; having shown him that
this hope is an earnest of it, and put in one very necessary caution,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>provoked at those miscreants whom he afterwards, Ep. iii. ver. 263, describes
as building hell on spite, and heaven on pride, he upbraids them, from ver. 98
to 112, with the example of the poor Indian, to whom also nature hath given
this common hope of mankind: but though his untutored mind had betrayed
him into many childish fancies concerning the nature of that future state, yet
he is so far from excluding any part of his own species (a vice which could
proceed only from the pride of false science), that he humanely, though simply,
admits even his faithful dog to bear him company.</p>

<p>Ver. 113. <i>Go, wiser thou! &amp;c.</i>] He proceeds with these accusers of Providence,
from ver. 112 to 122, and shows them, that complaints against the
established order of things begin in the highest absurdity, from misapplied
reason and power; and end in the highest impiety, in an attempt to degrade
the God of heaven, and to assume his place:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Alone made perfect here, immortal there:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is, be made God, who only is perfect, and hath immortality: to which
sense the lines immediately following confine us:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-judge his justice, be the God of God.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 123. <i>In pride, in reas'ning pride, our error lies; &amp;c.</i>] From these
men, the poet now turns to his friend; and, from ver. 122 to 130, remarks,
that the ground of all this extravagance is pride; which, more or less, infects
the whole reasoning tribe; shows the ill effects of it, in the case of the fallen
angels; and observes, that even wishing to invert the laws of order, is a lower
species of their crime. He then brings an instance of one of the effects of
pride, which is the folly of thinking everything made solely for the use of
man, without the least regard to any other of the creatures of God.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The ridicule of imagining the greater portions of the material system to be
solely for the use of man, true philosophy has sufficiently exposed: and
common sense, as the poet observes, instructs us to conclude, that our fellow-creatures,
placed by Providence as the joint inhabitants of this globe, are
designed to be joint sharers with us of its blessings:</p>

<p>Ver. 141. <i>But errs not nature from this gracious end,</i>] The author comes
next to the confirmation of his thesis, That partial moral evil is universal
good; but introduceth it with an allowed instance in the natural world, to
abate our wonder at the phenomenon of moral evil; which he forms into an
argument on a concession of his adversaries. If we ask you, says he, from
ver. 140 to 150, whether nature doth not err from the gracious purpose of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
Creator, when plagues, earthquakes, and tempests unpeople whole regions at a
time; you readily answer, No: for that God acts by general, and not by
particular laws; and that the course of matter and motion must be necessarily
subject to some irregularities, because nothing is created perfect. I then ask,
why you should expect this perfection in man? If you own that the great
end of God (notwithstanding all this deviation) be general happiness, then
it is nature and not God that deviates; do you expect greater constancy
in man?</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Then nature deviates; and can man do less?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is, if nature, or the inanimate system (on which God hath imposed his
laws, which it obeys, as a machine obeys the hand of the workman), may in
course of time deviate from its first direction, as the best philosophy shows it
may; where is the wonder that man, who was created a free agent, and hath
it in his power every moment to transgress the eternal rule of right, should
sometimes go out of order?</p>

<p>Ver. 151. <i>As much that end, &amp;c.</i>] Having thus shown how moral evil came
into the world, namely, by man's abuse of his own free-will, our poet comes
to the point, the confirmation of his thesis, by showing how moral evil
promotes good; and employs the same concessions of his adversaries, concerning
natural evil, to illustrate it.</p>

<p>1. He shows it tends to the good of the whole, or universe, from ver. 151
to 164, and this by analogy. You own, says he, that storms and tempests,
clouds, rain, heat, and variety of seasons, are necessary (notwithstanding
the accidental evil they bring with them) to the health and plenty of this
globe; why then should you suppose there is not the same use, with regard
to the universe, in a Borgia or a Catiline? But you say you can see the
one, and not the other. You say right: one terminates in this system,
the other refers to the whole: which whole can be comprehended by none but
the great Author himself. For, says the poet in another place,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i6">
Of this frame, the bearings and the ties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong connexions, nice dependencies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gradations just, has thy pervading soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look'd through? or can a part contain the whole?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Own therefore, says he, that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Account for moral, as for nat'ral things:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why charge we heav'n in those, in these acquit?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In both, to reason right, is to submit.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 165. <i>Better for us, &amp;c.</i>] But, secondly, to strengthen the foregoing
analogical argument, and to make the wisdom and goodness of God still more
apparent, he observes, from ver. 165 to 172, that moral evil is not only productive
of good to the whole, but is even productive of good in our own
system. It might, says he, perhaps appear better to us, that there were
nothing in this world but peace and virtue;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
That never air or ocean felt the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never passion discomposed the mind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But then consider, that as our material system is supported by the strife of
its elementary particles, so is our intellectual system, by the conflict of our
passions, which are the elements of human action. In a word, as without the
benefit of tempestuous winds, both air and ocean would stagnate, corrupt, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
spread universal contagion throughout all the ranks of animals that inhabit,
or are supported by, them; so, without the benefit of the passions, such virtue
as was merely the effect of the absence of those passions, would be a lifeless
calm, a stoical apathy.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Contracted all, retiring to the breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But health of mind is exercise, not rest.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Therefore, instead of regarding the conflicts of the elements, and the passions
of the mind, as disorders, you ought to consider them as part of the general
order of Providence: and that they are so, appears from their always preserving
the same unvaried course, throughout all ages, from the creation to the present
time:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
The gen'ral order, since the whole began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is kept in nature, and is kept in man.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We see, therefore, it would be doing great injustice to our author to suspect
that he intended by this to give any encouragement to vice. His system, as
all his Ethic Epistles show, is this: That the passions, for the reasons given
above, are necessary to the support of virtue: that, indeed, the passions in
excess produce vice, which is, in its own nature, the greatest of all evils, and
comes into the world from the abuse of man's free-will; but that God, in his
infinite wisdom and goodness, deviously turns the natural bias of its malignity
to the advancement of human happiness, and makes it productive of general
good:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Th' eternal art educes good from all.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, set against what we have observed of the poet's doctrine of a future
state, will furnish us with an instance of his steering (as he well expresses it
in his preface) "between doctrines seemingly opposite: if his Essay has any
merit, he thinks it is in this." And doubtless it is uncommon merit to reject
the visions and absurdities of every system, and take in only what is rational
and real. The Characteristics and the Fable of the Bees are two seemingly
inconsistent systems; the folly of the first is in giving a scheme of virtue
without religion; and the knavery of the latter, in giving a scheme of religion
without virtue. These our poet leaves to any that will take them up; but
agrees, however, so far with the first, that "virtue would be worth having,
though itself was its only reward;" and so far with the latter, that "God
makes evil, against its nature, productive of good."</p>

<p>Ver. 173. <i>What would this man? &amp;c.</i>] Having thus justified Providence
in its permission of partial moral evil, our author employs the remaining part
of his Epistle in vindicating it from the imputation of certain supposed
natural evils. For now he shows, from ver. 172 to 207, that though the
complaint of his adversaries against Providence be on pretence of real moral
evils; yet, at bottom, it all proceeds from their impatience under imaginary
natural ones, the issue of a depraved appetite for visionary advantages, which
if man had, they would be either useless or pernicious to him, as repugnant
to his state, or unsuitable to his condition. Though God, says he, hath so
bountifully bestowed on man faculties little less than angelic, yet he ungratefully
grasps at higher; and then, extravagant in another extreme, with a
passion as ridiculous as that is impious, envies, as what would be advantages
to himself, even the peculiar accommodations of brutes. But here his own
false principles expose the folly of his falser appetites. He supposes them all
made for his use: now what use could he have of them, when he had robbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
them of all their qualities? Qualities distributed with the highest wisdom, as
they are divided at present; but which, if bestowed according to the froward
humour of these childish complainers, would be everywhere found to be
either wanting or superfluous. But even though endowed with these brutal
qualities, man would not only be no gainer, but a considerable loser; as the
poet shows in explaining the consequences which would follow from his having
his sensations in that exquisite degree in which this or the other animal is
observed to possess them.</p>

<p>Ver. 207. <i>Far as creation's ample range extends,</i>] He tells us next, from
ver. 206 to 233, that the complying with such extravagant desires would not
only be useless and pernicious to man, but would be breaking into the order,
and deforming the beauty of God's creation, in which this animal is subject
to that, and every one to man, who, by his reason, enjoys the sum of all their
powers.</p>

<p>Ver. 233. <i>See, through this air, &amp;c.</i>] And further, from ver. 232 to 267,
that this breaking the order of things, which, as a link or chain, connects all
beings, from the highest to the lowest, would unavoidably be attended with
the destruction of the universe; for that the several parts of it must at least
compose as entire and harmonious a whole as the parts of a human body, can
be doubted of by no one. Yet we see what confusion it would make upon our
frame, if the members were set upon invading each other's office:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
What if the foot, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Who will not acknowledge, therefore, that a connexion in the disposition of
things, so harmonious as here described, is transcendently beautiful? But
the fatalists suppose such an one. What then? Is the First Free Agent, the
great Cause of all things, debarred a contrivance infinitely exquisite, because
some men, to set up their idol, fate, absurdly represent it as presiding over
such a system?</p>

<p>Ver. 267. <i>All are but parts of one stupendous whole,</i>] Our author having
thus given a representation of God's work, as one entire whole, where all the
parts have a necessary dependence on, and relation to each other, and where
each particular part works and concurs to the perfection of the whole, as such
a system transcends vulgar ideas, to reconcile it to common conceptions he
shows, from ver. 266 to 281, that God is equally and intimately present to
every sort of substance, to every particle of matter, and in every instant of
being; which eases the labouring imagination, and makes us expect no less
from such a presence, than such a dispensation.</p>

<p>Ver. 281. <i>Cease then, nor order imperfection name:</i>] And now the poet,
as he had promised, having vindicated the ways of God to man, concludes,
from ver. 280 to the end, that, from what had been said, it appears, that
the very things we blame contribute to our happiness, either as unrelated
particulars, or at least as parts of the universal system; that our state of
ignorance was allotted to us out of compassion; that yet we have as much
knowledge as is sufficient to show us, that we are, and always shall be, as
blessed as we can bear; for that nature is neither a Stratonic chain of blind
causes and effects,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
(All nature is but art, unknown to thee,)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>nor yet the fortuitous result of Epicurean atoms,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
(All chance, direction, which thou canst not see):<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as those two speeches of atheism supposed it; but the wonderful art and contrivance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
unknown indeed to man, of an all-powerful, all-wise, all-good, and
free Being. And therefore we may be assured, that the arguments brought
above, to prove partial moral evil productive of universal good, are conclusive;
from whence one certain truth results, in spite of all the pride and
cavils of vain reason, That whatever is, is right.</p>

<p>That the reader may see in one view the exactness of the method, as
well as force of the argument, I shall here draw up a short synopsis of this
Epistle. The poet begins by telling us, his subject is an Essay on Man: that
his end of writing is to vindicate Providence: that he intends to derive his
arguments from the visible things of God seen in his system: lays down this
proposition, that of all possible systems, infinite wisdom has formed the best:
draws from thence two consequences; 1. That there must needs be somewhere
such a creature as man; 2. That the moral evil, which he is the author of, is
productive of the good of the whole. This is his general thesis; from whence
he forms this conclusion, that man should rest submissive and content, and
make the hopes of futurity his comfort; but not suffer this to be the occasion
of pride, which is the cause of all his impious complaints. He proceeds to
confirm his thesis. Previously endeavours to abate our wonder at the phenomenon
of moral evil; shows, first, its use to the perfection of the universe, by
analogy, from the use of physical evil in this particular system. Secondly, its
use in this system, where it is turned, providentially, from its natural bias, to
promote virtue. Then goes on to vindicate Providence from the imputation
of certain supposed natural evils, as he had before justified it for the permission
of real moral evil, in showing that, though the atheist's complaint against
Providence be on pretence of real moral evil, yet the true cause is his impatience
under imaginary natural evil; the issue of a depraved appetite for
fantastical advantages, which, if obtained, would be useless or hurtful to man,
and deforming of, and destructive to, the universe, as breaking into that
order by which it is supported. He describes that order, harmony, and close
connexion of the parts; and by showing the intimate presence of God to his
whole creation, gives a reason for an universe so amazingly beautiful and
perfect. From all this he deduces his general conclusion, That nature being
neither a blind chain of causes and effects, nor yet the fortuitous result of
wandering atoms, but the wonderful art and direction of an all-wise, all-good,
and free Being, Whatever is, is right, with regard to the disposition of God,
and its ultimate tendency; which, once granted, all complaints against
Providence are at an end.</p>

<hr />
<h3><span class="em1point33">COMMENTARY ON EPISTLE II.</span></h3>

<p>Ver. 2. <i>The proper study, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having shown, in the first Epistle,
that the ways of God are too high for our comprehension, rightly draws this
conclusion, and methodically makes it the subject of his introduction to the
second, which treats of the nature of man. But here presently the accusers
of Providence would be apt to object, and say, "Admit that we ran into an
excess, when we pretended to censure or penetrate the designs of Providence,
a matter, perhaps, too high for us, yet have not you gone as far into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
opposite extreme, while you only send us to the knowledge of ourselves?
You must mock us when you talk of this as a study; for who can doubt but
we are intimately acquainted with our own nature? The proper conclusion,
therefore, from your proof of our inability to comprehend the ways of God, is,
that we should turn ourselves to the study of the frame of general nature."
Thus, I say, would they be apt to object; for, of all men, those who call
themselves freethinkers are most given up to pride; especially to that kind
which consists in a boasted knowledge of man, the effects of which pride are
so well exposed in the first Epistle. The poet, therefore, to convince them
that this study is less easy than they imagine, replies, from ver. 2 to 19, to
the first part of the objection, by describing the dark and feeble state of the
human understanding, with regard to the knowledge of ourselves. And
further to strengthen this argument, he shows, in answer to the second part
of the objection, from ver. 18 to 31, that the highest advances in natural
knowledge may be easily acquired, and yet we, all the while, continue very
ignorant of ourselves. For that neither the clearest science, which results
from the Newtonian philosophy, nor the most sublime, which is taught by the
Platonic, will at all assist us in this self-study; nay, what is more, that
religion itself, when grown fanatical and enthusiastic, will be equally useless,
though pure and sober religion will best instruct us in man's nature; that
knowledge being necessary to religion, whose subject is man, considered in all
his relations, and consequently, whose object is God.</p>

<p>Ver. 31. <i>Superior beings, &amp;c.</i>] To give this second argument its full force,
he illustrates it, from ver. 30 to 43, by the noblest example that ever was in
science, the incomparable Newton, who, although he penetrated so far beyond
others into the works of God, yet could go no further in the knowledge of his
own nature than the generality of his fellows. Of which the poet assigns this
very just and adequate reason,&mdash;in all other sciences the understanding is
unchecked and uncontrolled by any opposite principle; but in the science of
man, the passions overturn as fast as reason can build up.</p>

<p>Ver. 43. <i>Trace science then, &amp;c.</i>] The conclusion, therefore, from the whole
is, from ver. 42 to 53, that as on the one hand, we should persist in the
study of nature, so, on the other, in order to arrive at science, we should proceed
in the simplicity of truth; and then the produce, though small, will yet
be real.</p>

<p>Ver. 53. <i>Two principles, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having shown the difficulty which
attends the study of man, proceeds to remove it, by laying before us the
elements or true principles of this science, in an account of the origin, use,
and end of the passions; which, in my opinion, contains the truest, clearest,
shortest, and consequently the best system of ethics that is anywhere to be
met with. He begins, from ver. 52 to 59, with pointing out the two grand
principles in human nature, self-love and reason. Describes their general
nature: the first sets man upon acting, the other regulates his action. However,
these principles are natural, not moral; and, therefore, in themselves,
neither good nor evil, but so only as they are directed. This observation is
made with great judgment, in opposition to the desperate folly of those
fanatics, who, as the ascetic, vainly pretend to eradicate self-love; or, as the
mystic, are more successful in stifling reason; and both, on the absurd fancy
of their being moral, not natural, principles.</p>

<p>Ver. 59. <i>Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;</i>] The poet proceeds,
from ver. 58 to 67, more minutely to mark out the distinct offices of these two
principles, which offices he had before assigned only in general; and here he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
shows their necessity; for without self-love, as the spring, man would be
unactive; and without reason as the balance, active to no purpose.</p>

<p>Ver. 67. <i>Most strength the moving principle requires:</i>] Having thus explained
the ends and offices of each principle, he goes on, from ver. 66 to 79,
to speak of their qualities; and shows how they are fitted to discharge those
functions, and answer their respective intentions. The business of self-love
being to excite to action, it is quick and impetuous; and moving instinctively,
has, like attraction, its force prodigiously increased as the object approaches,
and proportionably lessened as it recedes. On the contrary, reason, like the
Author of attraction, is always calm and sedate, and equally preserves itself
whether the object be near or far off. Hence the moving principle is made
more strong, though the restraining be more quick-sighted. The consequence
he draws from this is, that if we would not be carried away to our destruction,
we must always keep reason upon guard.</p>

<p>Ver. 79. <i>Attention, &amp;c.</i>] But it would be objected, that if this account be
true, human life would be most miserable; and even in the wisest, a perpetual
conflict between reason and the passions. To this, therefore, the poet replies,
from ver. 78 to 81, first, that Providence has so graciously contrived, that
even in the voluntary exercise of reason, as in the mechanic motion of a limb,
habit makes what was at first done with pain, easy and natural. And
secondly, that the experience gained by the long exercise of reason, goes a
great way towards eluding the force of self-love. Now the attending to
reason, as here recommended, will gain us this habit and experience. Hence
it appears, that our station, in which reason is to be kept constantly upon
guard, is not so uneasy a one as may be at first imagined.</p>

<p>Ver. 81. <i>Let subtle schoolmen, &amp;c.</i>] From this description of self-love and
reason, it follows, as the poet observes, from ver. 80 to 93, that both conspire
to one end, namely, human happiness, though they be not equally expert in
the choice of the means; the difference being this, that the first hastily seizes
every thing which has the appearance of good; the other weighs and examines
whether it be indeed what it appears. This shows, as he next observes, the
folly of the schoolmen, who consider them as two opposite principles, the one
good and the other evil. The observation is seasonable and judicious; for
this dangerous school-opinion gives great support to the Manichean or
Zoroastrian error, the confutation of which was one of the author's chief ends
in writing. For if there be two principles in man, a good and evil, it is
natural to think him the joint product of the two Manichean Deities (the first
of which contributed to his reason, the other to his passions), rather than the
creature of one Individual Cause. This was Plutarch's opinion, and as we
may see in him, of some of the more ancient theistical philosophers. It was
of importance, therefore, to reprobate and subvert a notion that served to the
support of so dangerous an error; and this the poet hath done with more
force and clearness than is often to be found in whole volumes written against
that heretical opinion.</p>

<p>Ver. 93. <i>Modes of self-love, &amp;c.</i>] Having given this account of the nature
of self-love in general, he comes now to anatomize it, in a discourse on the
passions, which he aptly names the modes of self-love. The object of all
these, he shows, from ver. 92 to 101, is good; and when under the guidance
of reason, real good, either of ourselves or of another; for some goods, not
being capable of division, or communication, and reason at the same time
directing us to provide for ourselves, we therefore, in pursuit of these objects,
sometimes aim at our own good, sometimes at the good of others. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
fairly aiming at our own, the quality is called prudence; when at another's,
virtue. Hence as he shows, from ver. 100 to 105, appears the folly of the
stoics, who would eradicate the passions, things so necessary both to the good
of the individual and of the kind. Which preposterous method of promoting
virtue he therefore very reasonably reproves.</p>

<p>Ver. 105. <i>The rising tempest puts in act the soul,</i>] But as it was from
observation of the evils occasioned by the passions, that the stoics thus
extravagantly projected their extirpation, the poet recurs, from ver. 104 to
111, to his grand principle, so often before, and to so good purpose, insisted
on, that partial ill is universal good; and shows, that though the tempest
of the passions, like that of the air, may tear and ravage some few parts
of nature in its passage, yet the salutary agitation produced by it preserves
the whole in life and vigour. This is his first argument against the stoics,
which he illustrates by a very beautiful similitude, on a hint taken from
Scripture:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Nor God alone in the still calm we find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 111. <i>Passions, like elements, &amp;c.</i>] His second argument against the
stoics, from ver. 110 to 133, is, that passions go to the composition of a moral
character, just as elementary particles go to the composition of an organized
body. Therefore, for man to project the destruction of what composes his
very being is the height of extravagance. It is true, he tells us, that these
passions, which, in their natural state, like elements, are in perpetual jar,
must be tempered, softened, and united, in order to perfect the work of the
great plastic Artist; who, in this office, employs human reason; whose business
it is to follow the road of nature, and to observe the dictates of the
Deity; follow her and God. The use and importance of this precept is evident:
for in doing the first, she will discover the absurdity of attempting to
eradicate the passions; in doing the second, she will learn how to make them
subservient to the interests of virtue.</p>

<p>Ver. 123. <i>Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes;</i>] His third argument
against the stoics, from ver. 122 to 127, is, that the passions are a continual
spur to the pursuit of happiness; which, without these powerful inciters, we
should neglect, and sink into a senseless indolence. Now happiness is the end
of our creation; and this excitement, the means to that end; therefore, these
movers, the passions, are the instruments of God, which he hath put into the
hands of reason to work withal.</p>

<p>Ver. 127. <i>All spread their charms, &amp;c.</i>] The poet now proceeds in his subject;
and this last observation leads him naturally to the discussion of his
next principle. He shows then, that though all the passions have their turn
in swaying the determinations of the mind, yet every man hath one master
passion, that at length stifles or absorbs all the rest. The fact he illustrates
at large in his Epistle to Lord Cobham. Here, from ver. 126 to 149, he giveth
us the cause of it. Those pleasures or goods, which are the objects of the
passions, affect the mind by striking on the senses; but as, through the
formation of the organs of our frame, every man hath some one sense stronger
and more acute than others, the object which strikes the stronger or acuter
sense, whatever it be, will be the object most desired; and consequently, the
pursuit of that will be the ruling passion: That the difference of force in this
ruling passion shall at first, perhaps, be very small, or even imperceptible;
but nature, habit, imagination, wit, nay, even reason itself, shall assist its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
growth, till it hath at length drawn and converted every other into itself. All
which is delivered in a strain of poetry so wonderfully sublime, as suspends,
for a while, the ruling passion in every reader, and engrosses his whole admiration.
This naturally leads the poet to lament the weakness and insufficiency
of human reason, from ver. 148 to 161, and the purpose he had in so
doing, was plainly to intimate the necessity of a more perfect dispensation to
mankind.</p>

<p>Ver. 161. <i>Yes, nature's road, &amp;c.</i>] Now as it appears from the account here
given of the ruling passion and its cause, which results from the structure
of the organs, that it is the road of nature, the poet shows, from ver. 160
to 167, that this road is to be followed. So that the office of reason is
not to direct us what passion to exercise, but to assist us in rectifying, and
keeping within due bounds, that which nature hath so strongly impressed;
because</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
A mightier pow'r the strong direction sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sev'ral men impels to several ends.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 167. <i>Like varying winds, &amp;c.</i>] The poet, having proved that the ruling
passion (since nature hath given it us) is not to be overthrown, but rectified;
the next inquiry will be, of what use the ruling passion is; for an use it must
have, if reason be to treat it thus mildly. This use he shows us, from ver. 166
to 197, is twofold, natural and moral.</p>

<p>1. Its natural use is to conduct men steadily to one certain end, who would
otherwise be eternally fluctuating between the equal violence of various and
discordant passions, driving them up and down at random; and, by that
means, to enable them to promote the good of society, by making each a contributor
to the common stock:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, please, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. Its moral use is to ingraft our ruling virtue upon it; and by that means
to enable us to promote our own good, by turning the exorbitancy of the ruling
passion into its neighbouring virtue:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
See anger, zeal and fortitude supply, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The wisdom of the Divine Artist is, as the poet finely observes, very illustrious
in this contrivance; for the mind and body having now one common
interest, the efforts of virtue will have their force infinitely augmented:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
'Tis thus the mercury, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 197. <i>Reason the bias, &amp;c.</i>] But lest it should be objected that this
account favours the doctrine of necessity, and would insinuate that men are
only acted upon, in the production of good out of evil; the poet teacheth, from
ver. 196 to 203, that man is a free agent, and hath it in his power to turn the
natural passions into virtues or into vices, properly so called:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Reason the bias turns to good from ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Secondly, if it should be objected, that though he doth, indeed, tell us some
actions are beneficial and some hurtful, yet he could not call those virtuous,
nor these vicious, because, as he hath described things, the motive appears to
be only the gratification of some passion, give me leave to answer for him, that
this would be mistaking the argument, which, to ver. 249 of this epistle, considers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
the passions only with regard to society, that is, with regard to their
effects rather than their motives: That, however, it is his design to teach that
actions are properly virtuous and vicious; and though it be difficult to distinguish
genuine virtue from spurious, they having both the same appearance,
and both the same public effects, yet that they may be disentangled. If it be
asked, by what means? he replies, from ver. 202 to 205, by conscience;&mdash;the
God within the mind;&mdash;and this is to the purpose; for it is a man's own concern,
and no one's else, to know whether his virtue be pure and solid; for what
is it to others, whether this virtue (while, as to them, the effect of it is the
same) be real or imaginary?</p>

<p>Ver. 205. <i>Extremes in nature equal ends produce, &amp;c.</i>] But still it will be
said, Why all this difficulty to distinguish true virtue from false? The poet
shows why, from ver. 204 to 211, that though indeed vice and virtue so invade
each other's bounds, that sometimes we can scarce tell where one ends and the
other begins, yet great purposes are served thereby, no less than the perfecting
the constitution of the whole, as lights and shades, which run into one another
insensibly in a well-wrought picture, make the harmony and spirit of the
composition. But on this account to say there is neither vice nor virtue, the
poet shows, from ver. 211 to 217, would be just as wise as to say, there is
neither black nor white, because the shade of that, and the light of this, often
run into one another, and are mutually lost:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is an error of speculation, which leads men so foolishly to conclude, that
there is neither vice nor virtue.</p>

<p>Ver. 217. <i>Vice is a monster, &amp;c.</i>] There is another error, an error of practice,
which hath more general and hurtful effects; and is next considered, from
ver. 216 to 221. It is this, that though, at the first aspect, vice be so horrible
as to fright the beholder, yet, when by habit we are once grown familiar with
her, we first suffer, and in time begin to lose the memory of her nature, which
necessarily implies an equal ignorance in the nature of virtue. Hence men
conclude that there is neither one nor the other.</p>

<p>Ver. 221. <i>But where th' extreme of vice, &amp;c.</i>] But it is not only that extreme
of vice which stands next to virtue, which betrays us into these mistakes.
We are deceived too, as he shows us, from ver. 220 to 231, by our observations
concerning the other extreme. For, from the extreme of vice being
unsettled, men conclude that vice itself is only nominal, at least rather comparative
than real.</p>

<p>Ver. 231. <i>Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be,</i>] There is yet a third
cause of this error of no vice, no virtue, composed of the other two, <i>i.e.</i> partly
speculative, and partly practical. And this also the poet considers, from
ver. 230 to 239, showing it ariseth from the imperfection of the best characters,
and the inequality of all; whence it happens that no man is extremely virtuous
or vicious, nor extremely constant in the pursuit of either. Why it so
happens, the poet informs us, who with admirable sagacity assigns the cause
in this line:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For, vice or virtue, self directs it still.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>An adherence or regard to what is, in the sense of the world, a man's own
interest, making an extreme, in either, almost impossible. Its effect in
keeping a good man from the extreme of virtue needs no explanation; and,
in an ill man, self-interest showing him the necessity of some kind of reputation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
the procuring and preserving that will necessarily keep him from the
extreme of vice.</p>

<p>Ver. 239. <i>That counterworks each folly and caprice;</i>] The mention of
this principle, that self directs vice and virtue, and its consequence, which
is, that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>leads the author to observe,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
That heav'n's great view is one, and that the whole.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And this brings him naturally round again to his main subject, namely, God's
producing good out of ill, which he prosecutes from ver. 238 to 249.</p>

<p>Ver. 249. <i>Heav'n forming each on other to depend,</i>] I. Hitherto the poet
hath been employed in discoursing of the use of the passions, with regard to
society at large; and in freeing his doctrine from objections. This is the first
general division of the subject of this epistle.</p>

<p>II. He comes now to show, from ver. 248 to 261, the use of these passions,
with regard to the more confined circle of our friends, relations, and acquaintance;
and this is the second general division.</p>

<p>Ver. 261. <i>Whate'er the passion, &amp;c.</i>] III. The poet having thus shown the
use of the passions in society and in domestic life, comes, in the last place,
from ver. 260 to the end, to show their use to the individual, even in their
illusions; the imaginary happiness they present, helping to make the real
miseries of life less insupportable: and this is his third general division:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i6">
Opinion gilds with varying rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those painted clouds that beautify our days, &amp;c.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One prospect lost, another still we gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a vanity is giv'n in vain.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Which must needs vastly raise our idea of God's goodness; who hath not only
provided more than a counterbalance of real happiness to human miseries, but
hath even, in his infinite compassion, bestowed on those who were so foolish
as not to have made this provision, an imaginary happiness, that they may not
be quite overborne with the load of human miseries. This is the poet's great
and noble thought, as strong and solid as it is new and ingenious. It teaches,
that these illusions are the faults and follies of men, which they wilfully fall
into, and thereby deprive themselves of much happiness, and expose themselves
to equal misery; but that still, God, according to his universal way of
working, graciously turns these faults and follies so far to the advantage of his
miserable creatures, as to become, for a time, the solace and support of their
distresses:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Though man's a fool, yet God is wise.<br /></span>

<h3><span class="em1point33">COMMENTARY ON EPISTLE III.</span></h3>
<p>
We are now come to the third Epistle of the Essay on Man. It having
been shown, in explaining the origin, use, and end of the passions, in the
second Epistle, that man hath social as well as selfish passions, that doctrine
naturally introduceth the third, which treats of man as a social animal, and
connects it with the second, which considered him as an individual. And as
the conclusion from the subject of the first Epistle made the introduction to
the second, so here again, the conclusion of the second</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ev'n mean self-love becomes, by force divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scale to measure others' wants by thine,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>maketh the introduction to the third:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Here then we rest: 'The Universal Cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acts to one end, but acts by various laws.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The reason of variety in those laws, which tend to one and the same end, the
good of the whole generally, is, because the good of the individual is likewise
to be provided for; both which together make up the good of the whole
universally. And this is the cause, as the poet says elsewhere, that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Each individual seeks a several goal.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But to prevent our resting there, God hath made each need the assistance of
another; and so</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
On mutual wants built mutual happiness.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was necessary to explain the two first lines, the better to see the
pertinency and force of what followeth, from ver. 2 to 7, where the poet
warns such to take notice of this truth, whose circumstances placing them
in an imaginary station of independence, and inducing a real habit of insensibility
to mutual wants (from which wants general happiness results), make
them but too apt to overlook the true system of things; viz. the men in full
health and opulence. This caution was necessary with respect to society; but
still more necessary with respect to religion. Therefore he especially recommends
the memory of it as well to the clergy as laity when they preach or
pray; because the preacher who doth not consider the First Cause under this
view, as a Being consulting the good of the whole, must needs give a very
unworthy idea of him; and the supplicant, who prayeth as one not related to
a whole, or indifferent to the happiness of it, will not only pray in vain, but
offend his Maker by neglecting the interest of his dispensation.</p>

<p>Ver. 7. <i>Look round our world; &amp;c.</i>] He now introduceth his system of
human sociability, ver. 7, 8, by showing it to be the dictate of the Creator;
and that man, in this, did but follow the example of general nature, which is
united in one close system of benevolence.</p>

<p>Ver. 9. <i>See plastic nature working to this end</i>,] This he proveth, first, from
ver. 8 to 13, on the noble theory of attraction, from the economy of the
material world, where there is a general conspiracy in all the particles of
matter to work for one end, the use, beauty, and harmony of the whole mass.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>

Ver. 13. <i>See matter next, &amp;c.</i>] The second argument, from ver. 12 to 27, is
taken from the vegetable and animal world, whose parts serve mutually for
the production, support, and sustentation of each other. But the observation,
that God</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Connects each being, greatest with the least;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made beast in aid of man, and man of beast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All served, all serving,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>awaking again the pride of his impious adversaries, who cannot bear that
man should be thought to be serving as well as served, he takes this occasion
again to humble them, from ver. 26 to 49, by the same kind of argument
he had so successfully employed in the first Epistle, and which the comment
on that epistle hath considered at large.</p>

<p>Ver. 49. <i>Grant that the pow'rful still the weak control;</i>] However, his
adversaries, loth to give up the question, will reason upon the matter; and
we are now to suppose them objecting against Providence in this manner.
"We grant," they say, "that in the irrational, as in the inanimate creation,
all is served, and all is serving: but with regard to man, the case is different:
he standeth single: for his reason hath endowed him both with power and
address sufficient to make all things serve him; and his self-love, of which
you have so largely provided for him, will indispose him, in his turn, to serve
any: therefore your theory is imperfect." Not so, replies the poet, from
ver. 48 to 79. I grant that man, indeed, affects to be the wit and tyrant of the
whole, and would fain shake off</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i16">
that chain of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combining all below and all above:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But nature, even by the very gift of reason, checks this tyrant. For reason,
endowing man with the ability of setting together the memory of the past
with his conjectures about the future, and past misfortunes making him
apprehensive of more to come, this disposeth him to pity and relieve others
in a state of suffering. And the passion growing habitual, naturally
extendeth its effects to all that have a sense of suffering. Now as brutes
have neither man's reason, nor his inordinate self-love, to draw them from
the system of beneficence, so they wanted not, and therefore have not, this
human sympathy of another's misery, by which passion, we see, those
qualities, in man, balance one another, and so retain him in that orderly
connexion, in which Providence hath placed its whole creation. But this is
not all: man's interest and amusement, his vanity and luxury, tie him still
closer to the system of beneficence, by obliging him to provide for the support
of other animals, and though it be, for the most part, only to devour them
with the greater gust, yet this does not abate the proper happiness of the
animals so preserved, to whom Providence hath not imparted the useless
knowledge of their end. From all which it appears, that the theory is yet
uniform and perfect.</p>

<p>Ver. 79. <i>Whether with reason, &amp;c.</i>] But even to this as a caviller would still
object, we must suppose he does so. "Admit," says he, "that nature hath
endowed all animals, whether human or brutal, with such faculties as
admirably fit them to promote the general good, yet, in its care for this, hath
not nature neglected to provide for the private good of the individual? We
have cause to think she hath; and we suppose, it was on exclusive consideration,
that she kept back from brutes the gift of reason (so necessary a
means of private happiness), because reason, as we find in the case of man,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
where there is occasion for all the complicated contrivance you have described
above, to make the effects of his passions counterwork the immediate powers
of his reason, in order to keep him subservient to the general system; reason,
we say, naturally tendeth to draw beings into a private independent system."
This the poet answers, by showing, from ver. 78 to 109, that the happiness of
animal and that of human life are widely different: the happiness of human
life consisting in the improvement of the mind, can be procured by reason
only; but the happiness of animal life consisting in the gratifications of sense,
is best promoted by instinct. And, with regard to the regular and constant
operation of each, in that, instinct hath plainly the advantage; for here God
directs immediately; there only mediately through man.</p>

<p>Ver. 109. <i>God, in the nature of each being, &amp;c.</i>] The author now cometh
to the main subject of his epistle, the proof of man's sociability, from the
two general societies composed by him; the natural, subject to paternal
authority; and the civil, subject to that of a magistrate. This he hath the
address to introduce, from what had preceded, in so easy and natural a
manner, as showeth him to have the art of giving all the grace to the
dryness and severity of method, as well as wit to the strength and depth of
reason. The philosophic nature of his work requiring he should show by
what reason those societies were introduced, this affords him an opportunity
of sliding gracefully and easily from the preliminaries into the main subject;
and so of giving his work that perfection of method, which we find only in
the compositions of great writers. For having just before, though to a
different purpose, described the power of bestial instinct to attain the happiness
of the individual, he goeth on, in speaking of instinct as it is serviceable
both to that, and to the kind, from ver. 108 to 147, to illustrate the original
of society. He showeth, that though, as he had before observed, God had
founded the proper bliss of each creature in the nature of its own existence,
yet these not being independent individuals, but parts of a whole, God, to
bless that whole, built mutual happiness on mutual wants. Now, for the
supply of mutual wants, creatures must necessarily come together, which is
the first ground of society amongst men. He then proceeds to that called
natural, subject to paternal authority, and arising from the union of the two
sexes; describes the imperfect image of it in brutes; then explains it at
large in all its causes and effects. And lastly shows, that, as in fact, like
mere animal society, it is founded and preserved by mutual wants, the
supplial of which causeth mutual happiness, so it is likewise in right, as a
rational society, by equity, gratitude, and the observance of the relation
of things in general.</p>

<p>Ver. 147. <i>Nor think in nature's state they blindly trod;</i>] But the atheist
and Hobbist, against whom Mr. Pope argueth, deny the principle of right, or
of natural justice, before the invention of civil compact, which, they say, gave
being to it; and accordingly have had the effrontery publicly to declare, that
a state of nature was a state of war. This quite subverteth the poet's natural
society; therefore, after this account of that state, he proceedeth to support
the reality of it, by overthrowing the opponent principle of no natural
justice; which he doth, from ver. 146 to 169, by showing in a fine description
of the state of innocence, as represented in Scripture, that a state of nature
was so far from being without natural justice, that it was, at first, the reign
of God, where right and truth universally prevailed.</p>

<p>Ver. 169. <i>See him from nature rising slow to art!</i>] Strict method (in which,
by this time, the reader finds the poet to be more conversant, than some were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
aware of) leads him next to speak of that society, which succeeded the natural,
namely, the civil. He first explains, from ver. 169 to 199, the intermediate
means which led mankind from natural to civil society. These were the invention
and improvement of arts. For while men lived in a mere state of nature,
there was no need of any other government than the paternal; but when arts
were found out and improved, then that more perfect form, under the direction
of a magistrate, became necessary. And for these reasons; first, to bring those
arts, already found, to perfection; and, secondly, to secure the product of
them to their rightful proprietors. The poet, therefore, comes now, as we
say, to the invention of arts; but being always intent on the great end for
which he wrote his Essay, namely, to mortify that pride which occasions all
the impious complaints against Providence, he speaks of these inventions
as only lessons learned of mere animals guided by instinct, and thus, at
the same time, gives a new instance of the wonderful Providence of God,
who hath continued to teach mankind in a way, not only proper to humble
human pride, but to raise our idea of divine wisdom to the highest pitch.
This he does in a prosopop&oelig;ia the most sublime that ever entered into the
human imagination:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Thus then to man the voice of nature spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Go, from the creatures thy instructions take, &amp;c.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for those arts mere instinct could afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be crowned as monarchs, or as Gods adored."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The delicacy of the poet's address in the first part of the last line is very
remarkable. In this paragraph he hath given an account of those intermediate
means which led men from natural to civil society, that is to say, the invention
and improvement of arts. Now here, on his conclusion of this account,
and on his entry upon the description of civil society itself, he connects the
two parts the most gracefully that can be conceived, by this true historical circumstance,
that it was the invention of those arts which raised to the magistracy,
in this new society formed for the perfecting of them.</p>

<p>Ver. 199. <i>Great nature spoke;</i>] After all this necessary preparation, the
poet shows, from ver. 198 to 209, how civil society followed, and the advantages
it produced.</p>

<p>Ver. 209. <i>Thus states were formed;</i>] Having thus explained the original of
civil society, he shows us next, from ver. 208 to 215, that to this society a
civil magistrate, properly so called, did belong. And this in confutation of
that idle hypothesis, which pretends that God conferred the regal title on the
fathers of families; from whence men, when they had instituted society, were
to fetch their governors. On the contrary, our author shows that a king was
unknown till common interest, which led men to institute civil government,
led them at the same time to institute a governor. However, that it is true
that the same wisdom or valour, which gained regal obedience from sons to
the sire, procured kings a paternal authority, and made them considered as
fathers of their people, which probably was the original (and, while mistaken,
continues to be the chief support) of that slavish error, antiquity representing
its earliest monarchs under the idea of a common father, πατηρ ανδρων.
Afterwards, indeed, they became a kind of foster-fathers, ποιμενα λαων,
Homer calls one of them, till at length they began to devour that flock they
had been so long accustomed to shear; and, as Plutarch says of Cecrops,
εκ χρηστου βασιλεως αγριον και δρακοντωδη γενομενον τυραννον.</p>

<p>Ver. 215. <i>Till then, by nature crowned, &amp;c.</i>] The poet now returns, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
ver. 215 to 241, to what he had left unfinished in his description of natural
society. This, which appears irregular, is, indeed, a fine instance of his
thorough knowledge of method. I will explain it. This third epistle, we
see, considers man with respect to society; the second, with respect to himself;
and the fourth, with respect to happiness. But in none of these relations
does the poet ever lose sight of him under that in which he stands to God.
It will follow, therefore, that speaking of him with respect to society, the
account would be most imperfect, were he not at the same time considered
with respect to his religion; for between these two there is a close, and, while
things continue in order, a most interesting connexion:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
True faith, true policy united ran;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was but love of God, and this of man.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now religion suffering no change or depravation when man first entered into
civil society, but continuing the same as in the state of nature, the author, to
avoid repetition, and to bring the account of true and false religion nearer to
one another, in order to contrast them by the advantage of that situation,
deferred giving an account of his religion till he had spoken of the origin of
civil society. Thence it is, that he here resumes the account of the state of
nature, that is, so much of it as he had left untouched, which was only the
religion of it. This consisting in the knowledge of the one God, the Creator
of all things, he shows how men came by that knowledge: that it was either
found out by reason, which giving to every effect a cause, instructed them to
go from cause to cause, till they came to the first, who, being causeless, would
necessarily be judged self-existent; or else that it was taught by tradition,
which preserved the memory of the creation. He then tells us what these
men, undebauched by false science, understood by God's nature and attributes:
first, of God's nature, that they easily distinguished between the
worker and the work; saw the substance of the Creator to be distinct and
different from that of the creature, and so were in no danger of falling into
the horrid opinion of the Greek philosophers, and their follower, Spinoza.
And simple reason teaching them that the Creator was but one, they easily
saw that all was right, and so were in as little danger of falling into the
Manichean error, which, when oblique wit had broken the steady light of
reason, imagined all was not right, having before imagined that all was
not the work of One. Secondly, he shows, what they understood of God's
attributes; that they easily acknowledged a Father where they found a
Deity, and could not conceive a sovereign Being to be any other than a
sovereign Good.</p>

<p>Ver. 241. <i>Who first taught souls enslaved, &amp;c.</i>] Order leadeth the poet to
speak, from ver. 240 to 245, of the corruption of civil society into tyranny,
and its causes; and here, with all the dexterity of address, as well as force of
truth, he observes, it arose from the violation of that great principle, which
he so much insists upon throughout his Essay, that each was made for the use
of all. We may be sure, that in this corruption, where right or natural justice
was cast aside, and violence, the atheist's justice, presided in its stead, religion
would follow the fate of civil society. We know, from ancient history, it did
so. Accordingly Mr. Pope, from ver. 244 to 269, together with corrupt
politics, describes corrupt religion and its causes. He first informs us, agreeable
to his exact knowledge of antiquity, that it was the politician, and not
the priest (as the illiterate tribe of freethinkers would make us believe), who
first corrupted religion. Secondly, that the superstition he brought in was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
not invented by him, as an engine to play upon others (as the dreaming atheist
feigns, who would thus account for the origin of religion), but was a trap he
first fell into himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Superstition taught the tyrant awe.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 269. <i>So drives self-love, &amp;c.</i>] The inference our author draws from all
this, from ver. 268 to 283, is, that self-love driveth through right and wrong;
it causeth the tyrant to violate the rights of mankind; and it causeth the
people to vindicate that violation. For self-love being common to the whole
species, and setting each individual in pursuit of the same objects, it became
necessary for each, if he would secure his own, to provide for the safety of
another's. And thus equity and benevolence arose from that same self-love
which had given birth to avarice and injustice:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
His safety must his liberty restrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All join to guard what each desires to gain.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The poet hath not anywhere shown greater address, in the disposition of
this work, than with regard to the inference before us, which not only giveth
a proper and timely support to what had been advanced in the second Epistle
concerning the nature and effects of self-love, but is a necessary introduction
to what follows, concerning the reformation of religion and society; as we
shall see presently.</p>

<p>Ver. 283. <i>'Twas then, the studious head, &amp;c.</i>] The poet hath now described
the rise, perfection, and decay of civil policy and religion in the more early
times. But the design had been imperfect, had he dropped his discourse here.
There was, in after-ages, a recovery of these from their several corruptions.
Accordingly, he hath chosen that happy era for the conclusion of his song.
But as good and ill governments and religions succeed one another without
ceasing, he now leaveth facts, and turneth his discourse, from ver. 282 to 295,
to speak of a more lasting reform of mankind, in the invention of those philosophic
principles, by whose observance a policy and a religion may be for ever
kept from sinking into tyranny and superstition:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
'Twas then, the studious head, or generous mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow'r of God, or friend of human kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poet or patriot, rose but to restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faith and moral, nature gave before; &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The easy and just transition into this subject from the foregoing is admirable.
In the foregoing he had described the effects of self-love; and now, with great
art and high probability, he maketh men's observations on these effects the
occasion of those discoveries which they have made of the true principles of
policy and religion, described in the present paragraph; and this he evidently
hinteth at in that fine transition:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
'Twas then, the studious head, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 295. <i>Such is the world's great harmony, &amp;c.</i>] Having thus described
the true principles of civil and ecclesiastical policy, he proceedeth, from
ver. 294 to 303, to illustrate the harmony between the two policies, by the
universal harmony of nature:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Such is the world's great harmony, that springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From order, union, full consent of things.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus, as in the beginning of this epistle he supported the general principle of
mutual love or association, by considerations drawn from the particular properties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
of matter, and the mutual dependence between vegetable and animal
life, so, in the conclusion, he hath enforced the particular principles of civil
and religious society, from that general harmony, which springs, in part, from
those properties and dependencies.</p>

<p>Ver. 303. <i>For forms of government let fools contest; &amp;c.</i>] But now the poet,
having so much commended the invention and inventors of the philosophic
principles of religion and government, lest an evil use should be made of this,
by men's resting in theory and speculation, as they have been always apt to
do in matters where practice makes their happiness, he cautions his reader,
from ver. 302 to 311, against this error. The seasonableness of this reproof
will appear evident enough to those who know that mad disputes about liberty
and prerogative had once well nigh overturned our constitution; while others
about mystery and church authority had almost destroyed the very spirit of
our religion.</p>

<p>Ver. 311. <i>Man, like the generous vine, &amp;c.</i>] Having thus largely considered
man in his social capacity, the poet, in order to fix a momentous
truth in the mind of his reader, concludes the Epistle in recapitulating the
two principles which concur to the support of this part of his character,
namely, self-love and social, and in showing that they are only two different
motions of the appetite to good, by which the Author of Nature hath enabled
man to find his own happiness in the happiness of the whole. This
he illustrates with a thought as sublime as that general harmony which he
describes:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
On their own axis as the planets run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet make at once their circle round the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So two consistent motions act the soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one regards itself, and one the whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus God and nature linked the general frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade self-love and social be the same.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For he hath the art of converting poetical ornament into philosophic reasoning;
and of improving a simile into an analogical argument; of which, more
in our next.</p>


<hr />
<h3><span class="em1point33">COMMENTARY ON EPISTLE IV.</span></h3>

<p>The two foregoing Epistles having considered man with regard to the means
(that is, in all his relations, whether as an individual, or a member of society),
this last comes to consider him with regard to the end, that is, happiness. It
opens with an invocation to happiness, in the manner of the ancient poets;
who, when destitute of a patron god, applied to the muse; and if she was not
at leisure, took up with any simple virtue next at hand, to inspire and prosper
their undertakings. This was the ancient invocation, which few modern poets
have had the art to imitate with any degree either of spirit or decorum: but
our author has contrived to make his subservient to the method and reasoning
of his philosophic composition. I will endeavour to explain so uncommon a
beauty. It is to be observed, that the pagan deities had each their several
names and places of abode, with some of which they were supposed to be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
delighted than others, and consequently to be then most propitious when
invoked by the favourite name and place. Hence we find the hymns of
Homer, Orpheus, and Callimachus to be chiefly employed in reckoning up
the several titles and habitations by which the patron god was known and
distinguished. Our poet hath made these two circumstances serve to introduce
his subject. His purpose is to write of happiness: method, therefore, requires
that he first define what men mean by happiness, and this he does in the
ornament of a poetic invocation, in which the several names that happiness
goes by are enumerated:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Oh happiness! our being's end and aim!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good, pleasure, ease, content! whate'er thy name.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>After the definition, that which follows next is the proposition, which is,
that human happiness consists not in external advantages, but in virtue.
For the subject of this Epistle is to detect the false notions of happiness, and
to settle and explain the true; and this the poet lays down in the next sixteen
lines. Now the enumeration of the several situations where happiness is
supposed to reside, is a summary of false happiness placed in externals:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Plant of celestial seed! if dropped below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair op'ning to some court's propitious shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twined with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or reaped in from harvests of the field?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The six remaining lines deliver the true notion of happiness, and show that it
is rightly placed in virtue, which is summed up in these two:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Fixed to no spot is happiness sincere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis no where to be found, or every where.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The poet, having thus defined his terms, and laid down his proposition, proceeds
to the support of his thesis, the various arguments of which make up
the body of the epistle.</p>

<p>Ver. 19. <i>Ask for the learn'd, &amp;c.</i>] He begins, from ver. 18 to 29, with detecting
the false notions of happiness. These are of two kinds, the philosophical and
popular. The popular he had recapitulated in the invocation, when happiness
was called upon, at her several supposed places of abode: the philosophical
only remained to be delivered:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ask of the learn'd the way? The learn'd are blind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some place the bliss in action, some in ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those call it pleasure, and contentment these.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>They differed as well in the means, as in the nature of the end. Some placed
happiness in action, some in contemplation; the first called it pleasure, the
second ease. Of those who placed it in action and called it pleasure, the route
they pursued either sunk them into sensual pleasures, which ended in pain;
or led them in search of imaginary perfections, unsuitable to their nature and
station, see Ep. i., which ended in vanity. Of those who placed it in ease,
the contemplative station they were fixed in made some, for their quiet, find
truth in every thing; others, in nothing:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Who thus define it, say they more or less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this, that happiness is happiness?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>

The confutation of these philosophic errors he shows to be very easy, one
common fallacy running through them all, namely this, that instead of telling
us in what the happiness of human nature consists, which was what was asked
of them, each busies himself in explaining in what he placed his own.</p>

<p>Ver. 29. <i>Take natures path, &amp;c.</i>] The poet then proceeds, from ver. 28 to
35, to reform their mistakes; and shows them that, if they will but take the
road of nature, and leave that of mad opinion, they will soon find happiness
to be a good of the species, and, like common sense, equally distributed to all
mankind.</p>

<p>Ver. 35. <i>Remember, man, &amp;c.</i>] Having exposed the two false species of happiness,
the philosophical and popular, and announced the true; in order to
establish the last, he goes on to a confutation of the two former.</p>

<p>I. He first, from ver. 34 to 49, confutes the philosophical, which, as we
said, makes happiness a particular, not a general good. And this two ways;
1. From his grand principle, that God acts by general laws; the consequence
of which is, that happiness, which supports the well-being of every system,
must needs be universal, and not partial, as the philosophers conceived. 2. From
fact, that man instinctively concurs with this designation of Providence, to
make happiness universal, by his having no delight in any thing uncommunicated
or uncommunicable.</p>

<p>Ver. 49. <i>Order is heaven's first law;</i>] II. In the second place, from ver. 48
to 67, he confutes the popular error concerning happiness, namely, that it consists
in externals. This he does, first, by inquiring into the reasons of the
present providential disposition of external goods,&mdash;a topic of confutation
chosen with the greatest accuracy and penetration. For, if it appears they
were given in the manner we see them distributed, for reasons different from
the happiness of individuals, it is absurd to think that they should make part
of that happiness. He shows, therefore, that disparity of external possessions
among men was for the sake of society: 1. To promote the harmony and
happiness of a system; because the want of external goods in some, and the
abundance in others, increase general harmony in the obligor and obliged.
Yet here, says he, mark the impartial wisdom of heaven; this very inequality
of externals, by contributing to general harmony and order, produceth an
equality of happiness amongst individuals. 2. To prevent perpetual discord
amongst men equal in power, which an equal distribution of external goods
would necessarily occasion. From hence he concludes, that as external goods
were not given for the reward of virtue, but for many different purposes,
God could not, if he intended happiness for all, place it in the enjoyment of
externals.</p>

<p>Ver. 67. <i>Fortune her gifts may variously dispose, &amp;c.</i>] His second argument,
from ver. 66 to 73, against the popular error of happiness being placed in
externals, is, that the possession of them is inseparably attended with fear;
the want of them with hope; which directly crossing all their pretensions to
making happy, evidently shows that God had placed happiness elsewhere.
And hence, in concluding this argument, he takes occasion, from ver. 72 to
77, to upbraid the desperate folly and impiety of those who, in spite of God
and nature, will yet attempt to place happiness in externals:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Oh sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mountains piled on mountains, to the skies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heav'n still with laughter the vain toil surveys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>

Ver. 77. <i>Know, all the good, &amp;c.</i>] The poet having thus confuted the two
errors concerning happiness, the philosophical and popular, and proved that
true happiness was neither solitary and partial, nor yet placed in externals,
goes on, from ver. 76 to 83, to show in what it doth consist. He had before
said in general, and repeated it, that happiness lay in common to the whole
species. He now brings us better acquainted with it, in a more explicit
account of its nature, and tells us, it is all contained in health, peace, and
competence; but that these are to be gained only by virtue, namely, by
temperance, innocence, and industry.</p>

<p>Ver. 83. <i>The good or bad, &amp;c.</i>] Hitherto the poet hath only considered
health and peace:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
But health consists with temperance alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peace, oh virtue! peace is all thy own.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>One head yet remained to be spoken to, namely, competence. In the pursuit
of health and peace there is no danger of running into excess; but the case is
different with regard to competence: here wealth and affluence would be apt
to be mistaken for it, in men's passionate pursuit after external goods. To
obviate this mistake, therefore, the poet shows, from ver. 82 to 93, that, as
exorbitant wealth adds nothing to the happiness arising from a competence,
so, as it is generally ill-gotten, it is attended with circumstances which weaken
another part of this triple cord, namely, peace.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie in three words, health, peace, and competence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But health consists with temperance alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peace, oh virtue! peace is all thy own.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 93. <i>Oh blind to truth, &amp;c.</i>] Our author having thus largely confuted
the mistake, that happiness consists in externals, proceeds to expose the
terrible consequences of such an opinion, on the sentiments and practice of all
sorts of men; making the dissolute, impious and atheistical; the religious,
uncharitable and intolerant; and the good, restless and discontent. For
when it is once taken for granted, that happiness consists in externals, it is
immediately seen that ill men are often more happy than the good, which sets
all conditions on objecting to the ways of Providence, and some even on
rashly attempting to rectify his dispensations, though by the violation of all
laws, divine and human. Now this being the most important part of the
subject under consideration, is deservedly treated most at large. And here it
will be proper to take notice of the art of the poet in making this confutation
serve, at the same time, for a full solution of all objections which might be
made to his main proposition, that happiness consists not in externals.</p>

<p>1. He begins, first of all, with the atheistical complainers; and pursues
their impiety from ver. 93 to 131.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Oh blind to truth! and God's whole scheme below, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 97. <i>But fools, the good alone unhappy call, &amp;c.</i>] He exposes their
folly, even in their own notions of external goods. 1. By examples, from
ver. 98 to 111, where he shows, first, that if good men have been untimely
cut off, this is not to be ascribed to their virtue, but to a contempt of life,
which hurried them into dangers. Secondly, That if they will still persist in
ascribing untimely death to virtue, they must needs, on the same principle
,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
ascribe long life to it also; consequently, as the argument, in fact, concludes
both ways, in logic it concludes neither.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Say, was it virtue, more though heav'n ne'er gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lamented Digby! sunk thee to the grave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, if virtue made the son expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, full of days and honour, lives the sire?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 111. <i>What makes all physical or moral ill?</i>] 2. He exposes their
folly, from ver. 110 to 131, by considerations drawn from the system of
nature: and these twofold, natural and moral. You accuse God, says he,
because the good man is subject to natural and moral evil. Let us see whence
these proceed. Natural evil is the necessary consequence of a material world
so constituted. But that this constitution was best, we have proved in the
first Epistle. Moral evil ariseth from the depraved will of man. Therefore
neither one nor the other from God. But you say, adds the poet, to these
impious complainers, that though it be fit man should suffer the miseries
which he brings upon himself, by the commission of moral evil; yet it seems
unfit that his innocent posterity should bear a share of the burden. To this,
says he, I reply,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
We just as wisely might of heav'n complain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That righteous Abel was destroyed by Cain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that the righteous son is ill at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his lewd father gave the dire disease.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But you will still say, Why doth not God either prevent or immediately
repair these evils? You may as well ask, why he doth not work continual
miracles, and every moment reverse the established laws of nature:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Shall burning Etna, if a sage requires, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is the force of the poet's reasoning, and these the men to whom he
addresseth it, namely, the libertine cavillers against Providence.</p>

<p>Ver. 131. <i>But still this world, &amp;c.</i>] II. But now, so unhappy is the condition
of our corrupt nature, that these are not the only complainers.
Religious men are but too apt, if not to speak out, yet sometimes secretly
to murmur against Providence, and say, its ways are not equal. Those
especially, who are more inordinately devoted to a sect or party, are scandalised,
that the just, (for such they esteem themselves,) the just, who are to
judge the world, have no better a portion in their own inheritance and
dominion. The poet, therefore, now leaves those more professedly impious,
and turns to these less profligate complainers, from ver. 130 to 149:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
But still this world, so fitted for the knave, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the former wanted external goods to be the reward of virtue for the moral
man, so these want them for the pious, in order to have a kingdom of the
just. To this the poet holds it sufficient to answer: Pray first agree
among yourselves who those just are. As they are not likely to do this, he
bids them to rest satisfied; to remember his fundamental principle, that
whatever is, is right; and to content themselves (as their religion teaches
them to profess a more than ordinary submission to the will of Providence)
with that common answer which he, with so much reason and piety, gives to
every kind of complainer. However, though there be yet no kingdom of the
just, there is still no kingdom of the unjust; both the virtuous and the vicious
(whatsoever becomes of those whom every sect calls the faithful) have their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
share in external goods; and what is more, the virtuous have infinitely the
most enjoyment of their share:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i16">
This world, 'tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was made for Cæsar, but for Titus too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which more bless'd? who chained his country? say!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or he whose virtue sighed to lose a day?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have been the more solicitous to explain this last argument, and to show
against whom it is directed, because a great deal depends upon it for the
illustration of the sense, and the defence of the poet's reasoning. For if we
suppose him to be still addressing himself to those impious complainers, confuted
in the forty preceding lines, we should make him guilty of a paralogism,
in the argument about the just; and in the illustration of it by the case of
Calvin. For then the libertine asks, Why the just, that is, the moral man,
is not rewarded? The answer is, that none but God can tell, who the just,
that is, the faithful man, is. Where the term is changed, in order to support
the argument; for about the truly moral man there is no dispute; about the
truly faithful or the orthodox, a great deal. But take the poet right, as
arguing here against religious complainers, and the reasoning is strict and
logical. They ask, why the truly faithful are not rewarded? He answereth,
they may be for aught you know; for none but God can tell who they are.</p>

<p>Ver. 149. <i>"But sometimes virtue starves, while vice is fed."</i>] III. The poet,
having dispatched these two species of murmurers, comes now to the third,
and still more pardonable sort, the discontented good men, who lament only
that virtue starves, while vice riots. To these he replies, from ver. 148 to 157,
that, admit this to be the case, yet they have no reason to complain, either
of the good man's lot in particular, or of the dispensation of Providence in
general. Not of the former, because happiness, the reward of virtue, consisteth
not in externals; nor of the latter, because ill men may gain wealth
by commendable industry; good men want necessaries through indolence or
ill conduct.</p>

<p>Ver. 157. <i>But grant him riches, &amp;c.</i>] But as modest as this complaint
seemeth at first view, the poet next shows, from ver. 156 to 167, that it
is founded on a principle of the highest extravagance, which will never let
the discontented good man rest, till he becomes as vain and foolish in his
imagination as the very worst sort of complainers. For that when once he
begins to think he wants what is his due, he will never know where to stop,
while God hath any thing to give.</p>

<p>Ver. 167. <i>What nothing earthly gives, &amp;c.</i>] But this is not all; the poet
showeth next, from ver. 166 to 185, that these demands are not only
unreasonable, but in the highest degree absurd likewise. For that those very
goods, if granted, would be the destruction of that virtue for which they are
demanded as a reward. He concludes, therefore, on the whole, that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul's calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is virtue's prize,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And that to aim at other, which not only is of no use to us here, but, what
is more, will be of none hereafter, is a passion like that of an infant or a
savage, where the one is impatient for what he will soon despise, and the
other makes a provision for what he can never want.</p>

<p>Ver. 185. <i>To whom can riches give repute, or trust,</i>] The poet now enters
more at large upon the matter; and still continuing his discourse to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
third sort of complainers (whom he indulgeth, as much more pardonable
than the first or second, in rectifying all their doubts and mistakes), he
proves, both from reason and example, how unable any of those things are,
which the world most admires, to make a good man happy. For as to the
philosophic mistakes concerning happiness, there being little danger of their
making a general impression, he had, after a short confutation, dismissed
them altogether. But external goods are those syrens, which so bewitch the
world with dreams of happiness, that it is of all things the most difficult to
awaken it out of its delusions; though, as he proves in an exact review of the
most pretending, they dishonour bad men, and add no lustre to the good.
That it is only this third, and least criminal sort of complainers, against
whom the remaining part of the discourse is directed, appeareth from the
poet's so frequently addressing himself, henceforward, to his friend.</p>

<p>I. He beginneth therefore, from ver. 184 to 205, with considering riches.
1. He examines first, what there is of real use or enjoyment in them; and
showeth, they can give the good man only that very contentment in himself,
and that very esteem and love from others, which he had before; and scornfully
cries out to those of a different opinion:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Oh fool! to think God hates the worthy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lover and the love of human-kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he wants a thousand pounds a year!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. He next examines the imaginary value of riches, as the fountain of
honour. For the objection of his adversaries standeth thus: As honour is the
genuine claim of virtue, and shame the just retribution of vice; and as
honour, in their opinion, follows riches, and shame, poverty, therefore the
good man should be rich. He tells them in this they are much mistaken:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Honour and shame from no condition rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Act well your part; there all the honour lies.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>What power then has fortune over the man? None at all; for as her favours
can confer neither worth nor wisdom; so neither can her displeasure cure him
of any of his follies. On his garb, indeed, she hath some little influence; but
his heart still remains the same:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Fortune in men has some small difference made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>So that this difference extends no further than to the habit; the pride of heart
is the same both in the flaunter and the flutterer, as it is the poet's intention
to insinuate by the use of those terms.</p>

<p>Ver. 205. <i>Stuck o'er with titles, &amp;c.</i>] II. Then, as to nobility, by creation
or birth; this too the poet shows, from ver. 204 to 217, is in itself as devoid
of all real worth as the rest; because, in the first case, the honour is
generally gained by no merit at all; in the second, by the merit of the first
founder of the family, which, when well considered, is generally the subject
rather of humiliation than of glory.</p>

<p>Ver. 217. <i>Look next on greatness; &amp;c.</i>] III. The poet now unmasks, from
ver. 216 to 237, the false pretences of greatness, whereby it is seen that the
hero and the politician (the two characters which would monopolize that
quality) do, after all their bustle, if they want virtue, effect only this, that the
one proves himself a fool, and the other a knave: and virtue they but too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
generally want; the art of heroism being understood to consist in ravage
and desolation; and the art of politics, in circumvention. It is not success,
therefore, that constitutes true greatness; but the end aimed at, and the
means which are employed. And if these be right, glory will follow as
the reward, whatever happens to be the issue:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Who noble ends by noble means obtains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Socrates, that man is great indeed.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 237. <i>What's fame?</i>] IV. With regard to fame, that still more fantastic
blessing, he showeth, from ver. 236 to 259, that all of it, besides what
we hear ourselves, is merely nothing; and that, even of this small portion,
no more of it giveth the possessor a real satisfaction, than what is the fruit of
virtue. Thus he shows, that honour, nobility, greatness, glory, so far as they
have any thing real and substantial, that is, so far as they contribute to the
happiness of the possessor, are the sole issue of virtue; and that neither
riches, courts, armies, nor the populace, are capable of conferring them.</p>

<p>Ver. 259. <i>In parts superior what advantage lies?</i>] V. But lastly, the poet
shows, from ver. 258 to 269, that as no external goods can make man happy,
so neither is it in the power of all internal. For that even superior parts
bring no more real happiness to the possessor than the rest; nay, that they
put him into a worse condition; for that the quickness of apprehension and
depth of penetration do but sharpen the miseries of life.</p>

<p>Ver. 269. <i>Bring then these blessings to a strict account; &amp;c.</i>] Having thus
proved how empty and unsatisfactory all these greatest external goods are,
from an examination of their nature; he proceeds to strengthen his argument,
from ver. 268 to 309, by these three further considerations:</p>

<p>1. That the acquirement of these goods is made with the loss of one
another, or of greater, either as inconsistent with them, or as spent in attaining
them.</p>

<p>2. That the possessors of each of these goods are generally such, as are so
far from raising envy in a good man, that he would refuse to take their
persons, though, accompanied with their possessions: and this the poet
illustrates by examples.</p>

<p>3. That even the possession of them altogether, where they have excluded
virtue, only terminates in more enormous misery.</p>

<p>Ver. 309. <i>Know then this truth, &amp;c.</i>] Having thus at length shown that
happiness consists neither in external goods of any kind, nor in all kinds of
internal (that is, in such of them as are not of our own acquirement), nor yet
in the visionary pursuits of the philosophers, he concludes, from ver. 308 to
311, that it is to be found in virtue alone.</p>

<p>Ver. 311. <i>The only point when human bliss stands still, &amp;c.</i>] Hitherto the
poet had proved, negatively, that happiness consists in virtue, by showing,
that it did not consist in anything else. He now, from ver. 310 to 327,
proves the same positively, by an enumeration of the qualities of virtue, all
naturally adapted to give and to increase human happiness; as its constancy,
capacity, vigour, efficacy, activity, moderation, and self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>Ver. 327. <i>See the sole bliss heav'n could on all bestow!</i>] Having thus proved
that happiness is placed in virtue; he proves next, from ver. 326 to 329, that
it is rightly placed there; for that then, and then only, all may partake of it,
and all be capable of relishing it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>

Ver. 329. <i>Yet poor with fortune, &amp;c.</i>] The poet then, with some indignation,
observeth, from ver. 328 to 341, that as obvious and as evident as this truth
was, yet riches and false philosophy had so blinded the discernment even of
improved minds, that the possessors of the first placed happiness in externals,
unsuitable to man's nature; and the followers of the latter, in refined visions,
unsuitable to his situation: while the simple-minded man, with nature only
for his guide, found plainly in what it should be placed.</p>

<p>Ver. 341. <i>For him alone, hope leads from goal to goal,</i>] But this is not
all; the author shows further, from ver. 340 to 353, that when the simple-minded
man, on his first setting out in the pursuit of truth in order to happiness,
hath had the wisdom</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
To look through nature up to nature's God,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>(instead of adhering to any sect or party, where there was so great odds of
his choosing wrong), that then the benefit of gaining the knowledge of God's
will written in the mind, is not confined there; for standing on this sure
foundation, he is now no longer in danger of choosing wrong, amidst such
diversities of religions; but by pursuing this grand scheme of universal benevolence,
in practice as well as theory, he arrives at length to the knowledge
of the revealed will of God, which is the consummation of the system of
benevolence:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For him alone, hope leads from goal to goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens still, and opens on his soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till lengthened on to faith, and unconfined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pours thy bliss that fills up all the mind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 353. <i>Self-love, thus pushed to social, &amp;c.</i>] The poet, in the last place,
marks out, from ver. 352 to 373, the progress of his good man's benevolence,
pushed through natural religion to revealed, till it arrives to that height
which the sacred writers describe as the very summit of Christian perfection;
and shows how the progress of human differs from the progress of divine
benevolence. That the divine descends from whole to parts; but that the
human must rise from individual to universal. His argument for this
extended benevolence is, that, as God has made a whole, whose parts have
a perfect relation to, and an entire dependency on each other, man, by
extending his benevolence throughout that whole, acts in conformity to the
will of his Creator; and therefore this enlargement of his affection becomes a
duty. But the poet hath not only shown his piety in this observation, but
the utmost art and address likewise in the disposition of it. The Essay on
Man opens with exposing the murmurs and impious conclusions of foolish
men against the present constitution of things. As it proceeds, it occasionally
detects all those false principles and opinions, which led them to
conclude thus perversely. Having now done all that was necessary in
speculation, the author turns to practice, and ends his Essay with the
recommendation of an acknowledged virtue, charity,&mdash;which, if exercised in
that extent which conformity to the will of God requireth, would effectually
prevent all complaints against the present order of nature,&mdash;such complaints
being made with a total disregard to everything but their own private system,
and seeking remedy in the disorder, and at the expense of all the rest. This
observation,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is important. Rochefoucault, Esprit, and their coarse and wordy disciple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
Mandeville, had observed, that self-love was the origin of all those virtues
which mankind most admire, and therefore foolishly supposed it was the
end likewise, and so taught that the highest pretences to disinterestedness
were only the more artful disguises of self-love. But our author, who says
somewhere or other,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Of human nature, wit its worst may write;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We all revere it in our own despite,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>saw, as well as they, and everybody else, that the passions began in self-love;
yet he understood human nature better than to imagine that they ended
there. He knew that reason and religion could convert selfishness into its
very opposite; and therefore teacheth that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and thus hath vindicated the dignity of human nature, and the philosophic
truth of the christian doctrine.</p>

<p>Ver. 394. <i>Showed erring pride, whatever is, is right;</i>] The poet's address
to his friend, which concludeth this Epistle so nobly, and endeth with a
recapitulation of the general argument, affords me the following observation,
with which I shall conclude these remarks. There is one great beauty that
shines through the whole Essay. The poet, whether he speaks of man as an
individual, a member of society, or the subject of happiness, never misseth an
opportunity, while he is explaining his state under any of these capacities, to
illustrate it in the most artful manner by the enforcement of his grand principle,
that every thing tendeth to the good of the whole, from whence his
system gaineth the reciprocal advantage of having that grand theorem realized
by facts, and his facts justified on a principle of right or nature.</p>

<p>Thus I have endeavoured to analyse and explain the exact reasoning of
these four Epistles. Enough, I presume, to convince every one, that it hath
a precision, force, and closeness of connection rarely to be met with, even in
the most formal treatises of philosophy. Yet in doing this, it is but too
evident I have destroyed that grace and energy which animates the original.
And now let the reader believe, if he be so disposed, what M. de Crousaz, in
his critique upon this work, insinuates to be his own opinion, as well as that
of his friends: "Some persons," says he, "have conjectured that Mr. Pope
did not compose this Essay at once, and in a regular order; but that after he
had written several fragments of poetry, all finished in their kind, (one, for
example, on the parallel between reason and instinct, another upon man's
groundless pride, another on the prerogatives of human nature, another on
religion and superstition, another on the original of society, and several fragments
besides on self-love and the passions), he tacked these together as he
could, and divided them into four epistles; as, it is said, was the fortune of
Homer's Rhapsodies." I suppose this extravagance will be believed just as
soon of one as of the other. But M. Du Resnel, our poet's translator, is not
behind-hand with the critic, in his judgment on the work. "The only
reason," says he, "for which this poem can be properly termed an Essay, is,
that the author has not formed his plan with all the regularity of method
which it might have admitted." And again: "I was, by the unanimous
opinion of all those whom I have consulted on this occasion, and, amongst
these, of several Englishmen completely skilled in both languages, obliged to
follow a different method. The French are not satisfied with sentiments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
however beautiful, unless they be methodically disposed. Method being the
characteristic that distinguishes our performances from those of our neighbours,"
&amp;c. After having given many examples of the critical skill of this
wonderful man of method, in the foregoing notes, it is enough just to have
quoted this flourish of self-applause, and so to leave him to the laughter of
the world.</p>

NOTES ON EPISTLE I.</span></h3>

<p>Ver. 7, 8. <i>A wild,&mdash;Or garden,</i>] The wild relates to the human passions,
productive, as he explains in the second epistle, both of good and evil. The
garden to human reason, so often tempting us to transgress the bounds God
has set to it, and wander in fruitless enquiries.</p>

<p>Ver. 12. <i>Of all who blindly creep, &amp;c.</i>] <i>i.e.</i> Those who only follow the
blind guidance of their passions; or those who leave behind them common
sense and sober reason, in their high flights through the regions of metaphysics.
Both which follies are exposed in the fourth Epistle, where the
popular and philosophical errors concerning happiness are detected. The
figure is taken from animal life.</p>

<p>Ver. 15. <i>Laugh where we must, &amp;c.</i>] Intimating, that human follies are so
strangely absurd, that it is not in the power of the most compassionate, on
some occasions, to restrain their mirth; and that its crimes are so flagitious,
that the most candid have seldom an opportunity, on this subject, to exercise
their virtue.</p>

<p>Ver. 16. <i>Vindicate the ways of God to man.</i>] Milton's phrase, judiciously
altered, who says, justify the ways of God to man. Milton was addressing
himself to believers, and delivering reasons or explaining the ways of God;
this idea, the word justify precisely conveys. Pope was addressing himself to
unbelievers, and exposing such of their objections whose ridicule and absurdity
arises from the judicial blindness of the objectors; he, therefore, more fitly
employs the word vindicate, which conveys the idea of a confutation attended
with punishment. Thus suscipere vindictam legis, to undertake the defence
of the law, implies punishing the violators of it.</p>

<p>The sense is, "we see nothing of man but as he stands at present in his
station here; from which station, all our reasonings on his nature and end
must be drawn; and to this station they must all be referred." The consequence
is, that our reasonings on his nature and end must needs be very
imperfect.</p>

<p>Ver. 21. <i>Through worlds unnumbered, &amp;c.</i>] Hunc cognoscimus solummodo
per proprietates suas et attributa, et per sapientissimas et optimas rerum
structuras et causas finales. <i>Newtoni Princ. Schol. gen. sub. fin.</i></p>

<p>Ver. 30. <i>The strong connexions, nice dependencies,</i>] The thought is very
noble, and expressed with great beauty and philosophic exactness. The
system of the universe is a combination of natural and moral fitnesses, as the
human system is of body and spirit. By the strong connexions, therefore,
the poet alluded to the natural part; and by the nice dependencies, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
moral. For the Essay on Man is not a system of naturalism, on the philosophy
of Bolingbroke, but a system of natural religion, on the philosophy of
Newton. Hence it is, that where he supposes disorders may tend to some
greater good in the natural world, he supposes they may tend likewise to
some greater good in the moral, as appears from these sublime images in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
If plagues and earthquakes break not heav'n's design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then a Borgia or a Catiline?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows, but he whose hand the lightning forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who heaves old ocean, and who wings the storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pours fierce ambition in a Cæsar's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 35 to 42.] In these lines the poet has joined the beauty of argumentation
to the sublimity of thought; where the similar instances, proposed
for his adversaries' examination, show as well the absurdity of their complaints
against order, as the fruitlessness of their inquiries into the arcana of
the Godhead.</p>

<p>Ver. 41. <i>Or ask of yonder, &amp;c.</i>] On these lines M. Voltaire thus descants:
"Pope dit que l'homme ne peut savoir pourquoi les lunes de Jupiter sont
moins grandes que Jupiter. Il se trompe en cela; c'est une erreur pardonnable.
Il n'y a point de mathématicien qui n'eût fait voir," &amp;c. And so goes
on to show, like a great mathematician as he is, that it would be very inconvenient
for the page to be as big as his lord and master. It is pity all this
fine reasoning should proceed on a ridiculous blunder. The poet thus reproves
the impious complainer of the order of Providence: You are dissatisfied with
the weakness of your condition. But, in your situation, the nature of things
requires just such a creature as you are: in a different situation, it might have
required that you should be still weaker. And though you see not the reason
of this in your own case, yet, that reasons there are, you may see in the case
of other of God's creatures:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ask of yonder argent fields above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why Jove's satellites are less than Jove.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here, says the poet, the ridicule of the weeds' and the satellites' complaint,
had they the faculties of speech and reasoning, would be obvious to all;
because their very situation and office might have convinced them of their
folly. Your folly, says the poet to his complainers, is as great, though not
so evident, because the reason is more out of sight; but that a reason there
is, may be demonstrated from the attributes of the Deity. This is the poet's
clear and strong reasoning; from whence, we see, he was so far from saying,
that man could not know the cause why Jove's satellites were less than Jove,
that all the force of his reasoning turns upon this, that man did see and know
it, and should from thence conclude, that there was a cause of this inferiority
as well in the rational as in the material creation.</p>

<p>Ver. 64. <i>Egypt's God:</i>] Called so, because the god Apis was worshipped
universally over the whole land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Ver. 87. <i>Who sees with equal eye, &amp;c.</i>] Matt. x. 29.</p>

<p>Ver. 93. <i>What future bliss, &amp;c.</i>] It hath been objected, that "the system
of the best weakens the other natural arguments for a future state; because,
if the evils which good men suffer, promote the benefit of the whole, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
every thing is here in order, and nothing amiss that wants to be set right,
nor has the good man any reason to expect amends, when the evils he
suffered had such a tendency." To this it may be replied, 1. That the poet
tells us, Ep. iv. ver. 361, that God loves from whole to parts. Therefore, if,
in the beginning and progress of the moral system, the good of the whole be
principally consulted, yet, on the completion of it, the good of particulars
will be equally provided for. 2. The system of the best is so far from
weakening those natural arguments, that it strengthens and supports them.
For if those evils, to which good men are subject, be mere disorders, without
any tendency to the greater good of the whole, then, though we must, indeed,
conclude that they will hereafter be set right, yet this view of things, representing
God as suffering disorders for no other end than to set them right,
gives us too low an idea of the divine wisdom. But if those evils (according
to the system of the best) contribute to the greater perfection of the whole,
such a reason may be then given for their permission, as supports our idea of
divine wisdom to the highest religious purposes. Then, as to the good man's
hopes of retribution, these still remain in their original force: for our idea of
God's justice, and how far that justice is engaged to a retribution, is exactly
and invariably the same on either hypothesis. For though the system of the
best supposes that the evils themselves will be fully compensated by the good
they produce to the whole, yet this is so far from supposing that particulars
shall suffer for a general good, that it is essential to this system, that, at the
completion of things, when the whole is arrived to the state of utmost
perfection, particular and universal good shall coincide;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Such is the world's great harmony, that springs<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Which coincidence can never be, without a retribution to each good man for
the evils he has suffered here below.</p>

<p>Ver. 97. <i>from home,</i>] The construction is,&mdash;The soul, uneasy and confined,
being from home, expatiates, etc. By which words, it was the poet's purpose
to teach, that the present life is only a state of probation for another, more
suitable to the essence of the soul, and to the free exercise of its qualities.</p>

<p>Ver. 110. <i>He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;</i>] The French translator,
M. l'Abbé du Resnel, has turned the line thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Il ne désire point cette céleste flamme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui des purs Seraphins dévore, et nourrit l'ame.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> The savage does not desire that heavenly flame, which at the same time
that it devours the souls of pure seraphim, nourishes them. On which
M. de Crousaz (who, by the assistance of a translation abounding in these
absurdities, writ a Commentary on the Essay on Man, in which we find
nothing but greater absurdities) remarks, "Mr. Pope, in exalting the fire of
his poetry by an antithesis, throws occasionally his ridicule on those heavenly
spirits. The Indian, says the poet, contents himself without any thing of
that flame, which devours at the same time that it nourisheth." <i>Comm.</i>
p. 77. But the poet is clear of this imputation. Nothing can be more grave
or sober than his English, on this occasion; nor, I dare say, to do the translator
justice, did he aim to be ridiculous. It is the sober, solid theology of
the Sorbonne. Indeed, had such a writer as Mr. Pope used this school-jargon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
we might have suspected he was not so serious as he should be. The
reader, as he goes along, will see more of this translator's peculiarities. And
the conclusion of the commentary on the fourth Epistle will show why I have
been so careful to preserve them.</p>

<p>Ver. 131. <i>Ask for what end, &amp;c.</i>] If there be any fault in these lines, it is
not in the general sentiment, but in the ill choice of instances made use of in
illustrating it. It is the highest absurdity to think that earth is man's footstool,
his canopy the skies, and the heavenly bodies lighted up principally for
his use; yet surely, it is very excusable to suppose fruits and minerals given
for this end.</p>

<p>Ver. 150. <i>Then Nature deviates; &amp;c.</i>] "While comets move in very eccentric
orbs, in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the
planets move one and the same way in orbs concentric; some inconsiderable
irregularities excepted, which may have risen from the mutual actions of
comets and planets upon one another, and which will be apt to increase, till
this system wants a reformation." <i>Sir Isaac Newton's Optics, Quæst. ult.</i></p>

<p>Ver. 155. <i>If plagues, &amp;c.</i>] What hath misled M. de Crousaz in his
censure of this passage, is his supposing the comparison to be between the
effects of two things in this sublunary world; when not only the elegancy,
but the justness of it, consists in its being between the effects of a thing in
the universe at large, and the familiar, known effects of one in this sublunary
world. For the position enforced in these lines is this, that partial evil tends
to the good of the whole:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Respecting man, whatever wrong we call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, must be right, as relative to all.&mdash;Ver. 51.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>How does the poet enforce it? If you will believe this critic, in illustrating
the effects of partial moral evil in a particular system, by that of partial
natural evil in the same system, and so he leaves his position in the lurch. But
the poet reasons at another rate. The way to prove his point, he knew, was
to illustrate the effect of partial moral evil in the universe, by partial natural
evil in a particular system. Whether partial moral evil tend to the good of
the universe, being a question which, by reason of our ignorance of many
parts of that universe, we cannot decide but from known effects, the rules of
good reasoning require that it be proved by analogy, <i>i.e.</i> setting it by, and
comparing it with, a thing clear and certain; and it is a thing clear and
certain, that partial natural evil tends to the good of our particular system.</p>

<p>Ver. 157. <i>Who knows but He, &amp;c.</i>] The sublimity with which the great
Author of Nature is here characterized, is but the second beauty of this fine
passage. The greatest is the making the very dispensation objected to, the
periphrasis of his title.</p>

<p>Ver. 174. <i>And little less than angels, &amp;c.</i>] "Thou hast made him a little
lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour." Psalm
viii. 5.</p>

<p>Ver. 202. <i>And stunned him, &amp;c.</i>] This instance is poetical, and even
sublime, but misplaced. He is arguing philosophically in a case that required
him to employ the real objects of sense only: and, what is worse, he speaks
of this as a real object, If nature thundered, &amp;c. The case is different where,
in ver. 253, he speaks of the motion of the heavenly bodies, under the
sublime conception of ruling angels: for whether there be ruling angels or no,
there is real motion, which was all his argument wanted; but if there be no

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
music of the spheres, there was no real sound, which his argument was obliged
to find.</p>

<p>Ver. 209. <i>Mark how it mounts, to man's imperial race,</i>] M. du Resnel has
turned the latter part of the line thus,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Jusqu'à l'homme, ce chef, ce roi de l'univers.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Even to man, this head, this king of the universe," which is so sad a
blunder, that it contradicts the poet's peculiar system; who, although he
allows man to be king of this inferior world, yet he thinks it madness to make
him king of the universe. If the philosophy and argument of the poem could
not teach him this, yet methinks the poet's own words, in this very Epistle,
might have prevented his mistake:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
So man; who here seems principal alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If the translator imagined that Mr. Pope was speaking ironically where he
talks of man's imperial race, and so would heighten the ridicule of the original
by <i>ce roi de l'univers</i>, the mistake is still worse; for the force of the argument
depends upon its being said seriously; the poet being here speaking of a scale
from the highest to the lowest in the mundane system.</p>

<p>Ver. 224. <i>For ever separate, &amp;c.</i>] Near, by the similitude of the operation;
separate, by the immense difference in the nature of the powers.</p>

<p>Ver. 226. <i>What thin partitions, &amp;c.</i>] So thin, that the atheistic philosophers,
as Protagoras, held that thought was only sense: and from thence
concluded, that every imagination or opinion of every man was true; Πασα φαντασια εστιν αληθης.
But the poet determines more philosophically that
they are really and essentially different, how thin soever the partition be by
which they are divided. Thus (to illustrate the truth of this observation)
when a geometer considers a triangle, in order to demonstrate the equality of
its three angles to two right ones, he has the picture or image of some sensible
triangle in his mind, which is sense; yet, notwithstanding, he must needs
have the notion or idea of an intellectual triangle likewise, which is thought;
for this plain reason, because every image or picture of a triangle must needs
be obtusangular, or rectangular, or acutangular; but that which, in his mind,
is the subject of his proposition, is the ratio of a triangle, undetermined to
any of these species. On this account it was that Aristotle said,
Νοηματα τινι διοισει, του μη φαντασματα ειναι, η ουδε
ταυτα φαντασματα, αλλ' ουκ ανευ φαντασματων. "The conceptions of the mind differ somewhat from sensible
images; they are not sensible images, and yet not quite free or disengaged
from sensible images."</p>

<p>Ver. 243. <i>Or in the full creation leave a void, &amp;c.</i>] This is only an illustrating
allusion to the Aristotelian doctrines of <i>plenum</i> and <i>vacuum</i>, the full
and void here meant relating not to matter but to life.</p>

<p>Ver. 247. <i>And if each system in gradation roll,</i>] Alluding to the motion
of the planetary bodies of each system, and to the figures described by that
motion.</p>

<p>Ver. 251. <i>Let earth unbalanced</i>] <i>i.e.</i> Being no longer kept within its orbit
by the different directions of its progressive and attractive motions,&mdash;which,
like equal weights in a balance, keep it in an equilibre.</p>

<p>Ver. 253. <i>Let ruling angels, &amp;c.</i>] The poet, throughout this work, has,
with great art, used an advantage which his employing a Platonic principle
for the foundation of his Essay, had afforded him; and that is, the expressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
himself, as here, in Platonic language, which, luckily for his purpose, is
highly poetical, at the same time that it adds a grace to the uniformity of his
reasoning.</p>

<p>Ver. 259. <i>What if the foot, &amp;c.</i>] This fine illustration in defence of the
system of nature, is taken from St. Paul, who employed it to defend the
system of grace.</p>

<p>Ver. 266. <i>The great directing</i> <span class="smcap">Mind</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>]
"Veneramur autem et colimus
ob dominium. Deus enim sine dominio, providentiâ, et causis finalibus,
nihil aliud est quam fatum et natura." <i>Newtoni Princip. Schol. gener. sub
finem.</i></p>

<p>Ver. 268. <i>Whose body nature is, &amp;c.</i>] M. de Crousaz remarks, on this
line, that "A Spinozist would express himself in this manner." I believe he
would; for so the infamous Toland has done, in his atheist's liturgy, called
Pantheisticon. But so would St. Paul likewise, who, writing on this subject,
the omnipresence of God in his Providence, and in his Substance, says, in the
words of a pantheistical Greek poet, <i>In him we live, and move, and have our
being</i>; <i>i.e.</i> we are parts of him, <i>his offspring</i>: And the reason is, because a
religious theist and an impious pantheist both profess to believe the omnipresence
of God. But would Spinoza, as Mr. Pope does, call God the great
directing mind of all, who hath intentionally created a perfect universe? Or
would a Spinozist have told us,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
The workman from the work distinct was known?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>a line that overturns all Spinozism from its very foundations. But this
sublime description of the Godhead contains not only the divinity of St. Paul;
but, if that will not satisfy the men he writes against, the philosophy likewise
of Sir Isaac Newton. The poet says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
All are but parts of one stupendous whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose body nature is, and God the soul; &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The philosopher:&mdash;"In ipso continentur et moventur universa, sed absque
mutuâ passione. Deus nihil patitur ex corporum motibus; illa nullam
sentiunt resistentiam ex omnipræsentiâ Dei.&mdash;Corpore omni et figurâ corporeâ
destituitur.&mdash;Omnia regit et omnia cognoscit.&mdash;Cum unaquæque spatii,
particula sit semper, et unumquodque durationis indivisibile momentum,
ubique certe rerum omnium Fabricator ac Dominus non erit nunquam,
nusquam."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Pope:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the rapt seraph that adores and burns:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him, no high, no low, no great, no small;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton:&mdash;"Annon ex phænomenis constat esse entem incorporeum,
viventem, intelligentem, omnipræsentem, qui in spatio infinito,
tanquam sensorio suo, res ipsas intime cernat, penitusque perspiciat, totasque
intra se præsens præsentes complectatur?"</p>

<p>But now, admitting there were an ambiguity in these expressions, so great
that a Spinozist might employ them to express his own particular principles;
and such a thing might well be, because the Spinozists, in order to hide the
impiety of their principle, are wont to express the omnipresence of God in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
terms that any religious theist might employ; in this case, I say, how are we
to judge of the poet's meaning? Surely by the whole tenor of his argument.
Now, take the words in the sense of the Spinozists, and he is made, in the
conclusion of the epistle, to overthrow all he had been advancing throughout
the body of it: for Spinozism is the destruction of an universe, where every
thing tends, by a foreseen contrivance in all its parts, to the perfection of the
whole. But allow him to employ the passage in the sense of St. Paul, That
we, and all creatures, live, and move, and have our being in God; and then
it will be seen to be the most logical support of all that had preceded. For
the poet, having, as we say, laboured through his epistle to prove, that
every thing in the universe tends, by a foreseen contrivance, and a present
direction of all its parts, to the perfection of the whole, it might be objected,
that such a disposition of things, implying in God a painful, operose, and
inconceivable extent of Providence, it could not be supposed that such care
extended to all, but was confined to the more noble parts of the creation.
This gross conception of the First Cause the poet exposes, by showing that
God is equally and intimately present to every particle of matter, to every
sort of substance, and in every instant of being.</p>

<p>Ver. 277. <i>As full, as perfect, &amp;c.</i>] Which M. du Resnel translates thus,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Dans un homme ignoré sous une humble chaumière,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que dans le séraphin, rayonnant de lumière.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> "As well in the ignorant man, who inhabits a humble cottage, as in the
seraph encompassed with rays of light." The translator, in good earnest
thought, that a vile man that mourned could be no other than some poor
country cottager. Which has betrayed M. de Crousaz into this important
remark: "For all that, we sometimes find in persons of the lowest rank, a
fund of probity and resignation which preserves them from contempt; their
minds are, indeed, but narrow, yet fitted to their station," &amp;c. <i>Comm.</i> p. 120.
But Mr. Pope had no such childish idea in his head. He was here opposing
the human species to the angelic; and so spoke of the first, when compared
to the latter, as vile and disconsolate. The force and beauty of the reflection
depend upon this sense; and, what is more, the propriety of it.</p>

<p>Ver. 278. <i>As the rapt seraph, &amp;c.</i>] Alluding to the name seraphim, signifying
burners.</p>

<p>Ver. 294. <i>One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.</i>] It will be difficult to
think any caviller should have objected to this conclusion; especially when
the author, in this very epistle, has himself thus explained it:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Respecting man, whatever wrong we call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, must be right, as relative to all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So man, who here seems principal alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But without any regard to the evidence of this illustration, M. de Crousaz
exclaims: "See the general conclusion, All that is, is right. So that at the
sight of Charles the First losing his head on the scaffold, we must have said,
this is right; at the sight too of his judges condemning him, we must have
said, this is right; at the sight of some of these judges, taken and condemned
for the action which he had owned to be right, we must have cried out, this
is doubly right." Never was any thing more amazing than that the absurdities
arising from the sense in which this critic takes the great principle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
of whatever is, is right, did not show him his mistake. For could any one
in his senses employ a proposition in a meaning from whence such evident
absurdities immediately arise? I have observed, that this conclusion, whatever
is, is right, is a consequence of these premises, that partial evil tends to
universal good; which the author employs as a principle to humble the pride
of man, who would impiously make God accountable for his creation. What
then does common sense teach us to understand by whatever is, is right?
Did the poet mean right with regard to man, or right with regard to God;
right with regard to itself, or right with regard to its ultimate tendency?
Surely with regard to God; for he tells us his design is to vindicate the ways
of God to man. Surely with regard to its ultimate tendency; for he tells us
again, all partial ill is universal good. Ver. 291. Now is this any encouragement
to vice? Or does it take off from the crime of him who commits it,
that God providentially produces good out of evil? Had Mr. Pope abruptly
said in his conclusion, the result of all is, that whatever is, is right, the
objector had even then been inexcusable for putting so absurd a sense upon
the words, when he might have seen that it was a conclusion from the
general principle above-mentioned; and therefore must necessarily have
another meaning. But what must we think of him, when the poet, to
prevent mistakes, had delivered, in this very place, the principle itself,
together with this conclusion as the consequence of it?</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
All discord, harmony not understood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All partial evil, universal good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He could not have told his reader plainer that his conclusion was the consequence
of that principle, unless he had written therefore in great church
letters.</p>
<hr />

<h3><span class="em1point36">NOTES ON EPISTLE II.</span></h3>

<p>Ver. 3. <i>Placed on this isthmus, &amp;c.</i>] As the poet hath given us this sublime
description of man for the very contrary purpose to what sceptics are wont to
employ such kind of paintings, namely, not to deter men from the search,
but to excite them to the discovery of truth; he hath, with great judgment,
represented men as doubting and wavering between the right and wrong
object; from which state it is allowable to hope he may be relieved by a careful
and circumspect use of reason. On the contrary, had he supposed man so
blind as to be busied in choosing, or doubtful in his choice, between two
objects equally wrong, the case had appeared desperate, and all study of man
had been effectually discouraged. But M. du Resnel, not seeing the reason
and beauty of this conduct, hath run into the very absurdity, which I have
here shown Mr. Pope so artfully avoided. Of which the learned reader may
take the following proofs. The poet says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Man hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now he tells us it is man's duty to act, not rest, as the stoics thought; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
to this their principle, the latter word alludes, whose virtue, as he says
afterwards, is</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i14">
Fixed as in a frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contracted all, retiring to the breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strength of mind is exercise, not rest.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now hear the translator, who is not for mincing matters:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Seroit-il en naissant au travail condamné?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aux douceurs du répos seroit-il destiné?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and these are both wrong, for man is neither condemned to slavish toil and
labour, nor yet indulged in the luxury of repose. The poet says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
In doubt to deem himself a God, or beast.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> He doubts, as appears from the very next line, whether his soul be mortal
or immortal; one of which is the truth, namely, its immortality, as the poet
himself teaches, when he speaks of the omnipresence of God:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part.&mdash;Epist. i. 275.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The translator, as we say, unconscious of the poet's purpose, rambles as
before:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Tantôt de son esprit admirant l'excellence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il pense qu'il est Dieu, qu'il en a la puissance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et tantôt gémissant des besoins de son corps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il croit que de la brute, il n'a que les ressorts.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here his head, turned to a sceptical view, was running on the different
extravagances of Plato in his theology, and of Descartes in his physiology.
Sometimes, says he, man believes himself a real God; and sometimes again,
a mere machine: things quite out of the poet's thought in this place. Again,
the poet, in a beautiful allusion to Scripture sentiments, breaks out into this
just and moral reflection on man's condition here,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The translator turns this fine and sober thought into the most outrageous
scepticism:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ce n'est que pour mourir, qu'il est né, qu'il respire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et toute sa raison n'est presque qu'un délire.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and so make his author directly contradict himself, where he says of man,
that he hath</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Too much knowledge for the sceptic side.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 10. <i>Born but to die, &amp;c.</i>] The author's meaning is, that as we are
born to die, and yet do enjoy some small portion of life, so, though we
reason to err, yet we comprehend some few truths. This is the weak state
of reason, in which error mixes itself with all its true conclusions concerning
man's nature.</p>

<p>Ver. 11. <i>Alike in ignorance, &amp;c.</i>] <i>i.e.</i> The proper sphere of his reason is
so narrow, and the exercise of it so nice, that the too immoderate use of it
is attended with the same ignorance that proceeds from the not using it at
all. Yet though, in both these cases, he is abused by himself, he has it still
in his own power to disabuse himself, in making his passions subservient to
the means, and regulating his reason by the end of life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
Ver. 12. <i>Whether he thinks too little or too much:</i>] It is so true, that
ignorance arises as well from pushing our inquiries too far, as from not
carrying them far enough, that we may observe, when speculations, even
in science, are carried beyond a certain point,&mdash;that point where use is
reasonably supposed to end, and mere curiosity to begin,&mdash;they conclude in
the most extravagant and senseless inferences, such as the unreality of
matter; the reality of space; the servility of the will, &amp;c. The cause of
this sudden fall out of full light into utter darkness, seems not to arise from
the natural condition of things, but to be the arbitrary decree of infinite
wisdom and goodness, which imposed a barrier to the extravagances of its
giddy, lawless creature, always inclined to pursue truths of less importance
too far, and to neglect those which are more necessary for his improvement
in his station here.</p>

<p>Ver. 17. <i>Sole judge of Truth, in endless error hurled:</i>] Some have imagined
that the author, by, in endless error hurled, meant, cast into endless error, or
into the regions of endless error, and therefore have taken notice of it as an
incongruity of speech. But they neither understood the poet's language, nor
his sense. To hurl and cast are not synonymous; but related only as the
genus and species; for to hurl signifies not simply to cast, but to cast backward
and forward, and is taken from the rural game called hurling. So that,
into endless error hurled, as these critics would have it, would have been a
barbarism. His words therefore signify tossed about in endless error; and
this he intended they should signify, as appears from the antithesis, sole
judge of truth. So that the sense of the whole is, "Though, as sole judge
of truth, he is now fixed and stable; yet, as involved in endless error,
he is now again hurled, or tossed up and down in it." This shows us how
cautious we ought to be in censuring the expressions of a writer, one of
whose characteristic qualities was correctness of expression and propriety of
sentiment.</p>

<p>Ver. 20. <i>Go, measure earth, &amp;c.</i>] Alluding to the noble and useful labours
of the modern mathematicians, in measuring a degree at the equator and the
polar circle, in order to determine the true figure of the earth; of great
importance to astronomy and navigation; and which proved of equal honour
to the wonderful sagacity of Newton.</p>

<p>Ver. 22. <i>Correct old Time, &amp;c.</i>] This alludes to Newton's Grecian Chronology,
which he reformed on those two sublime conceptions, the difference
between the reigns of kings, and the generations of men; and the position of
the colures of the equinoxes and solstices at the time of the Argonautic
expedition.</p>

<p>Ver. 29, 30. <i>Go, teach Eternal Wisdom, &amp;c.</i>] These two lines are a conclusion
from all that had been said from ver. 18 to this effect: "Go now,
vain man, elated with thy acquirements in real science, and imaginary intimacy
with God; go, and run into all the extravagances I have exploded in
the first Epistle, where thou pretendest to teach Providence how to govern;
then drop into the obscurities of thy own nature, and thereby manifest thy
ignorance and folly."</p>

<p>Ver. 31. <i>Superior beings, &amp;c.</i>] In these lines the poet speaks to this
effect: "But to make you fully sensible of the difficulty of this study, I
shall instance in the great Newton himself, whom, when superior beings,
not long since, saw capable of unfolding the whole law of nature, they were
in doubt whether the owner of such prodigious sagacity should not be
reckoned of their order, just as men, when they see the surprising marks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
of reason in an ape, are almost tempted to rank him with their own kind."
And yet this wondrous man could go no further in the knowledge of himself
than the generality of his species. M. du Resnel, who understood nothing
of all this, translates these four celebrated lines thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Des célestes esprits la vive intelligence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regarde avec pitié notre foible science;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Newton, le grand Newton, que nous admirons tous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Est peut-être pour eux, ce qu'un singe est pour nous.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it is not the pity, but the admiration of the celestial spirits which is here
spoken of. And it was for no slight cause they admired; it was, to see a
mortal man unfold the whole law of nature. By which we see it was not
Mr. Pope's intention to bring any of the ape's qualities, but its sagacity, into
the comparison. But why the ape's, it may be said, rather than the sagacity
of some more decent animal, particularly the half-reasoning elephant, as the
poet calls it; which, as well on account of this its excellence, as for its
having no ridiculous side, like the ape, on which it could be viewed, seems
better to have deserved this honour? I reply, because, as a shape resembling
human (which only the ape has) must be joined with great sagacity, to raise
a suspicion that the animal, thus endowed, is related to man, so the
spirituality, which Newton had in common with angels, joined to a penetration
superior to man, made those beings suspect he might be one of their
order. On this ground of relation, we see the whole beauty of the thought
depends. And here let me take notice of a new species of the sublime, of
which our poet may be justly said to be the maker; so new, that we have
yet no name for it, though of a nature distinct from every other known beauty
of poetry. The two great perfections in works of genius are wit and sublimity.
Many writers have been witty; some have been sublime; and a few
have even possessed both these qualities separately. But none, that I know
of, besides our poet, hath had the art to incorporate them; of which he hath
given many examples, both in this Essay, and his other poems; one of the
noblest being the passage in question. This seems to be the last effort of
the imagination to poetical perfection; and in this compounded excellence, the
wit receives a dignity from the sublime, and the sublime a splendour from
the wit, which, in their state of separate existence, they neither of them had.
Yet a late critic, who writes with the decision of a Lord of Session on Parnassus,
thinks otherwise: "It may be gathered," says he, "from what is said
above, that wit and ridicule make not an agreeable mixture with grandeur.
Dissimilar emotions have a fine effect in a slow succession; but in a rapid
succession which approaches to co-existence, they will not be relished."<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a>
What pity is it, that the poet should here confute the critic, by doing what
the critic, with his rules, teaches us cannot be done. Boileau, who was both
poet and critic, had a clear view of this excellence in idea; while the mere
critic had no idea of what had been clearly set before his eyes.</p>

<p>Ver. 37. <i>Who saw its fires here rise, &amp;c.</i>] Sir Isaac Newton, in calculating
the velocity of a comet's motion, and the course it describes, when it becomes
visible in its descent to, and ascent from, the sun, conjectured, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
highest appearance of truth, that comets revolve perpetually round the sun,
in ellipses vastly eccentrical, and very nearly approaching to parabolas. In
which he was greatly confirmed, in observing between two comets a coincidence
in their perihelions, and a perfect agreement in their velocities.</p>

<p>Ver. 45. <i>vanity, or dress,</i>] These are the first parts of what the poet, in
the preceding line, calls the scholar's equipage of pride. By vanity, is
meant that luxuriancy of thought and expression in which a writer indulges
himself, to show the fruitfulness of his fancy or invention. By dress, is to
be understood a lower degree of that practice, in amplification of thought
and ornamental expression, to give force to what the writer would convey:
but even this, the poet, in a severe search after truth, condemns; and with
great judgment, conciseness of thought, and simplicity of expression, being
as well the best instruments, as the best vehicles of truth. Shakespeare
touches upon this latter advantage with great force and humour. The
flatterer says to Timon in distress, "I cannot cover the monstrous bulk of
their ingratitude with any size of words." The other replies, "Let it go
naked; men may see't the better."</p>

<p>Ver. 46. <i>Or learning's luxury, or idleness;</i>] The luxury of learning consists
in dressing up and disguising old notions in a new way, so as to make them
more fashionable and palatable; instead of examining and scrutinizing their
truth. As this is often done for pomp and show, it is called luxury; as it is
often done too to save pains and labour, it is called idleness.</p>

<p>Ver. 47. <i>Or tricks to show the stretch of human brain,</i>] Such as the
mathematical demonstration concerning the small quantity of matter; the
endless divisibility of it, &amp;c.</p>

Dieu lui-même, Dieu sort de son profond repos.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And so, makes an epicurean God, of the Governor of the universe. M. de
Crousaz does not spare this expression of God's coming out of his profound
repose. "It is," says he, "excessively poetical, and presents us with ideas
which we ought not to dwell upon," &amp;c. and then, as usual, blames the
author for the blunder of his translator. <i>Comm.</i> p. 158.</p>

<p>Ver. 109. <i>Nor God alone, &amp;c.</i>] These words are only a simple affirmation
in the poetic dress of a similitude, to this purpose: "Good is not only produced
by the subdual of the passions, but by the turbulent exercise of them,"&mdash;a
truth conveyed under the most sublime imagery that poetry could conceive
or paint. For the author is here only showing the providential issue
of the passions, and how, by God's gracious disposition, they are turned away
from their natural destructive bias, to promote the happiness of mankind.
As to the method in which they are to be treated by man, in whom they are
found, all that he contends for, in favour of them, is only this, that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
should not be quite rooted up and destroyed, as the stoics, and their followers,
in all religions, foolishly attempted. For the rest, he constantly repeats this

and is celebrated for the quickness of his parts by Cicero.</p>

<p>Ver. 147. <i>Reason itself, &amp;c.</i>] The Poet, in some other of his epistles, gives
examples of the doctrines and precepts here delivered. Thus, in that Of the
Use of Riches, he has illustrated this truth in the character of Cotta:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Old Cotta shamed his fortune and his birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet was not Cotta void of wit or worth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His kitchen vied in coolness with his grot?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Than bramins, saints, and sages did before.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 149. <i>We, wretched subjects, &amp;c.</i>] St. Paul himself did not choose to
employ other arguments, when disposed to give us the highest idea of the
usefulness of christianity (Rom. vii.) But it may be, the poet finds a remedy
in natural religion. Far from it. He here leaves reason unrelieved. What
is this, then, but an intimation that we ought to seek for a cure in that
religion, which only dares profess to give it?</p>

<p>Ver. 163. <i>'Tis hers to rectify, &amp;c.</i>] The meaning of this precept is, That as
the ruling passion is implanted by nature, it is reason's office to regulate,
direct, and restrain, but not to overthrow it. To reform the passion of
avarice, for instance, into a parsimonious dispensation of the public revenues:
to direct the passion of love, whose object is worth and beauty,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
To the first good, first perfect, and first fair,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>the το καλον τ' αγαθον, as his master Plato advises; and to restrain spleen to a
contempt and hatred of vice. This is what the poet meant, and what every
unprejudiced man could not but see he must needs mean, by rectifying the
master passion, though he had not confined us to this sense, in the reason he
gives of his precept in these words:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
A mightier pow'r the strong direction sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And several men impels to several ends;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>for what ends are they which God impels to, but the ends of virtue?</p>

<p>Ver. 175. <i>Th' eternal art, &amp;c.</i>] The author has, throughout these epistles,
explained his meaning to be that vice is, in its own nature, the greatest of
evils, and produced through the abuse of man's free will:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
What makes all physical and moral ill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There deviates nature, and here wanders will:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>but that God in his infinite goodness, deviously turns the natural bias of its
malignity to the advancement of human happiness. A doctrine very different
from the Fable of the Bees, which impiously and foolishly supposes it to have
that natural tendency.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
Ver. 204. <i>The god within the mind.</i>] A Platonic phrase for conscience;
and here employed with great judgment and propriety. For conscience either
signifies, speculatively, the judgment we pass of things upon whatever principles
we chance to have, and then it is only opinion, a very unable judge
and divider; or else it signifies, practically, the application of the eternal
rule of right (received by us as the law of God) to the regulation of our
actions; and then it is properly conscience, the god (or the law of God)
within the mind, of power to divide the light from the darkness in this Chaos
of the passions.</p>

<p>As these lines have been misunderstood, I shall give the reader their plain
and obvious meaning. To these frailties, says he, we owe all the endearments
of private life; yet when we come to that age, which generally disposes men
to think more seriously of the true value of things, and consequently of their
provision for a future state, the consideration, that the grounds of those joys,
loves, and friendships, are wants, frailties, and passions, proves the best
expedient to wean us from the world; a disengagement so friendly to that
provision we are now making for another state. The observation is new, and
would in any place be extremely beautiful, but has here an infinite grace and
propriety, as it so well confirms, by an instance of great moment, the general
thesis, that God makes ill, at every step, productive of good.</p>

<p>Ver. 270. <i>the poet in his muse.</i>] The author having said, that no one could
change his own profession or views for those of another, intended to carry his
observations still further, and show that men were unwilling to exchange
their own acquirements even for those of the same kind, confessedly larger,
and infinitely more eminent in another. To this end he wrote,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
What partly pleases, totally will shock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I question much, if Toland would be Locke.<br /></span>

<p>But wanting another proper instance of this truth, he reserved the lines
above for some following edition of this Essay, which he did not live to give.</p>

<p>Ver. 280. <i>And beads and pray'r-books are the toys of age:</i>] A satire on
what is called, in popery, the <i>Opus operatum</i>. As this is a description of the
circle of human life returning into itself by a second childhood, the poet has
with great elegance concluded his description with the same image with which
he set out, "And life's poor play is o'er."</p>

<p>Ver. 286. <i>And each vacuity of sense by pride:</i>] An eminent casuist, Father
Francis Garasse, in his Somme Théologique, has drawn a very charitable conclusion
from this principle, which he hath well illustrated: "Selon la
justice," says this equitable divine, "tout travail honnête doit être recompensé
de louange ou de satisfaction. Quand les bons esprits font un ouvrage
excellent, ils sont justement recompensés par les suffrages du public. Quand
un pauvre esprit travaille beaucoup, pour faire un mauvais ouvrage, il n'est
pas juste ni raisonnable, qu'il attende des louanges publiques; car elles ne lui
sont pas dues. Mais afin que ses travaux ne demeurent pas sans recompense,
Dieu lui donne une satisfaction personelle, que personne ne lui peut envier
sans une injustice plus que barbare; tout ainsi que Dieu, qui est juste, donne
de la satisfaction aux grenouilles de leur chant. Autrement la blâme public,
joint à leur mécontentement, seroit suffisant pour les réduire au désespoir."</p>

NOTES ON EPISTLE III.</span></h3>


<p>Ver. 3. <i>superfluous health,</i>] Immoderate labour and immoderate study are
equally the impairers of health. They whose station sets them above both,
must needs have an abundance of it, which not being employed in the
common service, but wasted in luxury and folly, the post properly calls a
superfluity.</p>

<p>Ver. 4. <i>impudence of wealth,</i>] Because wealth pretends to be wisdom, wit,
learning, honesty, and, in short, all the virtues in their turns.</p>

<p>Ver. 3-6.] M. du Resnel, not seeing into the admirable purpose of the
caution contained in these four lines, hath quite dropped the most material
circumstances contained in the last of them; and what is worse, for the sake
of a foolish antithesis, hath destroyed the whole propriety of the thought in
the two first; and so, between both, hath left his author neither sense nor
system.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Dans le sein du bonheur, ou de l'adversité.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now, of all men, those in adversity have least needs of this caution, as being
least apt to forget, that God consults the good of the whole, and provides for
it by procuring mutual happiness by means of mutual wants; it being seen
that such who yet retain the smart of any fresh calamity, are most compassionate
to others labouring under distresses, and most prompt and ready to
relieve them.</p>

<p>Ver. 9. <i>See plastic nature, &amp;c.</i>] M. du Resnel mistook this description of
the preservation of the material universe, by the quality of attraction, for a
description of its creation; and so translates it</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Vois du sein du Chaos éclater la lumière,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaque atome ébranlé courir pour s'embrasser, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This destroys the poet's fine analogical argument, by which he proves, from
the circumstance of mutual attraction in matter, that man, while he seeks
society, and thereby promotes the good of his species, co-operates with God's
general dispensation; whereas the circumstance of a creation proves nothing
but a Creator.</p>

<p>Ver. 12. <i>Formed and impelled, &amp;c.</i>] Formed and impelled are not words
of a loose, undistinguishable meaning thrown in to fill up the verse. This is
not our author's way; they are full of sense, and of the most philosophical
precision. For to make matter so cohere as to fit it for the uses intended by
its Creator, a proper configuration of its insensible parts is as necessary as
that quality so equally and universally conferred upon it, called attraction.
To express the first part of this thought, our author says formed; and to
express the latter, impelled.</p>

<p>Ver. 19, 20. <i>Like bubbles, &amp;c.</i>] M. du Resnel translates these two lines
thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Sort du néant, y rentre, et reparoit au jour.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He is here, indeed, consistently wrong: for having, as we said, mistaken the
poet's account of the preservation of matter for the creation of it, he commits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
the very same mistake with regard to the vegetable and animal systems; and
so talks now, though with the latest, of the production of things out of
nothing. Indeed, by his speaking of their returning into nothing, he has
subjected his author to M. de Crousaz's censure: "Mr. Pope descends to the
most vulgar prejudices, when he tells us that each being returns to nothing:
the vulgar think that what disappears is annihilated," &amp;c. <i>Comm.</i> p. 221.</p>

<p>Ver. 22. <i>One all-extending, all-preserving soul,</i>] Which, in the language of
Sir Isaac Newton, is "Deus omnipræsens est, non per virtutem solam, sed
etiam per substantiam: nam virtus sine substantiâ subsistere non potest."
<i>Newt. Princ. Schol. gen. sub fin.</i></p>

<p>Ver. 23. <i>greatest with the least;</i>] As acting more strongly and immediately
in beasts, whose instinct is plainly an external reason; which made an old

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">

<p>Ver. 45. <i>See all things for my use!</i>] On the contrary, the wise man hath
said, "The Lord hath made all things for himself." Prov. xvi. 4.</p>

<p>Ver. 50. <i>Be man the wit and tyrant of the whole:</i>] Alluding to the witty
system of that philosopher,<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> which made animals mere machines, insensible of
pain or pleasure; and so encouraged men in the exercise of that tyranny over
their fellow-creatures, consequent on such a principle.</p>

<p>Ver. 152. <i>Man walked with beast, joint tenant of the shade;</i>] The poet still
takes his imagery from Platonic ideas, for the reason given above. Plato had
said, from old tradition, that, during the golden age, and under the reign of
Saturn, the primitive language then in use was common to man and beasts.
Moral instructors took advantage of the popular sense of this tradition, to
convey their precepts under those fables which gave speech to the whole brute
creation. The naturalists understood the tradition in the contrary sense, to
signify, that, in the first ages, men used inarticulate sounds, like beasts, to
express their wants and sensations; and that it was by slow degrees they came
to the use of speech. This opinion was afterwards held by Lucretius,
Diodorus Sic., and Gregory of Nyss.</p>

<p>Ver. 156. <i>All vocal beings, &amp;c.</i>] This may be well explained by a sublime
passage of the Psalmist, who, calling to mind the age of innocence, and full of
the great ideas of those</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i16">
Chains of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combining all below and all above,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beast, man, or angel, servant, lord, or king;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>breaks out into this rapturous and divine apostrophe, to call back the devious
creation to its pristine rectitude; that very state our author describes above:
"Praise the Lord, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye
him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light," &amp;c. Psalm cxlviii.</p>

<p>Ver. 158. <i>Unbribed, unbloody, &amp;c.</i>] <i>i.e.</i> the state described from ver. 263 to
269 was not yet arrived. For then, when superstition was become so extreme
as to bribe the gods with human sacrifices, tyranny became necessitated to
woo the priest for a favourable answer.</p>

<p>Ver. 159. <i>Heav'n's attribute, &amp;c.</i>] The poet supposeth the truth of the
Scripture account, that man was created lord of this inferior world (Ep. i.
ver. 230).</p>

<p>
Subjected these to those, and all to thee.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
What hath misled some to imagine that our author hath here fallen into a
contradiction, was, I suppose, such passages as these, "Ask for what end the
heav'nly bodies shine," &amp;c.; and again, "Has God, thou fool! worked solely
for thy good," &amp;c. But, in truth, this is so far from contradicting what he
had said of man's prerogative, that it greatly confirms it, and the Scripture
account concerning it. And because the licentious manner in which this
subject has been treated, has made some readers jealous and mistrustful of the
author's sober meaning, I shall endeavour to explain it. Scripture says, that
man was made lord of this sublunary world. But intoxicated with pride, the
common effect of sovereignty, he erected himself, like little partial monarchs,
into a tyrant. And as tyranny consists in supposing all made for the use of
one, he took those freedoms with all, which are the consequence of such a
principle. He soon began to consider the whole animal creation as his slaves
rather than his subjects, as created for no use of their own, but for his use
only, and therefore treated them with the utmost cruelty; and not content,
to add insult to his cruelty, he endeavoured to philosophize himself into an
opinion that these animals were mere machines, insensible of pain or pleasure.
Thus man affected to be the wit as well as tyrant of the whole. So that it
became one who adhered to the Scripture account of man's dominion to
reprove this abuse of it, and to show that</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Heav'n's attribute was universal care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man's prerogative to rule, but spare.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ver. 171. <i>Thus then to man, &amp;c.</i>]</p>

<p>M. du Resnel has translated the lines thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
La nature indignée alors se fit entendre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Va, malheureux mortel, va, lui dit-elle, apprendre;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>One would wonder what should make the translator represent nature in such
a passion with man, and calling him names, at a time when Mr. Pope supposed
her in her best good-humour. But what led him into this mistake was
another as gross. His author having described the state of innocence which
ends at these lines,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Heav'n's attribute was universal care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man's prerogative to rule, but spare,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>turns from those times, to a view of these latter ages, and breaks out into this
tender and humane complaint,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Ah! how unlike the man of times to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of half that live the butcher and the tomb, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Unluckily, M. du Resnel took this man of times to come for the corrupter of
that first age, and so imagined the poet had introduced nature only to set
things right: he then supposed, of course, she was to be very angry; and not
finding the author had represented her in any great emotion, he was willing
to improve upon his original.</p>

<p>Ver. 174. <i>Learn from the beasts, &amp;c.</i>] See Pliny's <i>Nat. Hist.</i> 1. viii. c. 27,
where several instances are given of animals discovering the medicinal efficacy
of herbs, by their own use of them; and pointing out to some operations in
the art of healing, by their own practice.</p>

<p>Ver. 199. <i>observant men obeyed;</i>] The epithet is beautiful, as signifying
both obedience to the voice of nature, and attention to the lessons of the
animal creation. But M. l'Abbé, who has a strange fatality of contradicting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
his original, whenever he attempts to paraphrase, as he calls it, the sense,
turns the lines in this manner:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Par ces mots la nature excita l'industrie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et de l'homme féroce enchaina la furie.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Chained up the fury of savage man"; and so contradicts the author's whole
system of benevolence, and goes over to the atheist's, who supposes the
state of nature to be a state of war. What seems to have misled him was
these lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
What war could ravish, commerce could bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he returned a friend who came a foe.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But M. du Resnel should have considered, that though the author holds a
state of nature to be a state of peace, yet he never imagined it impossible that
there should be quarrels in it. He had said,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
So drives self-love through just and through unjust.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He pushes no system to an extravagance, but steers (as he says in his preface)

master of a family had for those under his care being their best security.</p>

<p>Ver. 211. <i>'Twas virtue only, &amp;c.</i>] Our author hath good authority for
this account of the origin of kingship. Aristotle assures us, that it was
virtue only, or in arts or arms: Καθισταται βασιλευς εκ των
επιεικων καθ' ὑπεροχην αρετης, η πραξεων των απο της αρετης, η καθ'
ὑπεροχην τοιουτου γενους.</p>

<p>Ver. 225. <i>Then, looking up, &amp;c.</i>] The poet here maketh their more serious
attention to religion to have arisen, not from their gratitude amidst abundance,
but from their inability in distress, by showing that, in prosperity, they rested
in second causes, the immediate authors of their blessings, whom they revered
as God; but that, in adversity, they reasoned up to the First:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">

<p>This, I am afraid, is but too true a representation of humanity.</p>

<p>Ver. 225 to 240.] M. du Resnel, not apprehending that the poet was here
returned to finish his description of the state of nature, has fallen into one of
the grossest errors that ever was committed. He has mistaken this account
of true religion for an account of the origin of idolatry, and thus he fatally
embellishes his own blunder:</p>

<span class="i0">Leur aveugle respect l'adore et le révère.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here you have one of the finest pieces of reasoning turned at once into a
heap of nonsense. The unlucky term of "Great first Father," was mistaken
by our translator to signify a "great grandfather." But he should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
considered, that Mr. Pope always represents God under the idea of a Father.
He should have observed, that the poet is here describing those men who</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">

<span class="i0">And owned a father, where they own'd a God!<br /></span>

<p>Ver. 231. <i>Ere wit oblique, &amp;c.</i>] A beautiful allusion to the effects of the
prismatic glass on the rays of light.</p>

<p>Ver. 242. <i>Th' enormous faith, &amp;c.</i>] In this Aristotle placeth the difference
between a king and a tyrant, that the first supposeth himself made for the
people; the other, that the people are made for him: Βουλεται δ' ὁ βασιλευς ειναι φυλαξ, ὁπως ὁι μεν κεκτημενοι τας
ουσιας μηθεν αδικον πασχωσιν, ὁ δε δημος μη hυβριζηται μηθεν· ἡ δε
τυραννις προς ουδεν αποβλεπει κοινον, ει μη της ιδιας ωφελειας χαριν.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pol. lib. V. cap. 10.</span></p>

<p>Ver. 245. <i>Force first made conquest, &amp;c.</i>] All this is agreeable to fact, and
shows our author's knowledge of human nature. For that impotency of mind,
as the Latin writers call it, which gives birth to the enormous crimes necessary
to support a tyranny, naturally subjects its owner to all the vain, as well
as real, terrors of conscience. Hence the whole machinery of superstition.
It is true, the poet observes, that afterwards, when the tyrant's fright was
over, he had cunning enough, from the experience of the effect of superstition
upon himself, to turn it, by the assistance of the priest (who for his reward
went shares with him in the tyranny) against the justly dreaded resentment
of his subjects. For a tyrant naturally and reasonably supposeth all his slaves
to be his enemies. Having given the causes of superstition, he next describeth
its objects:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The ancient pagan gods are here very exactly described. This fact evinceth
the truth of that original, which the poet gives to superstition; for if these
phantasms were first raised in the imagination of tyrants, they must needs
have the qualities here assigned to them. For force being the tyrant's virtue,
and luxury his happiness, the attributes of his god would of course be revenge
and lust; in a word, the antitype of himself. But there was another, and
more substantial cause, of the resemblance between a tyrant and a pagan
god; and that was the making gods of conquerors, as the poet says, and so
canonizing a tyrant's vices with his person. That these gods should suit a
people humbled to the stroke of a master will be no wonder, if we recollect a
generous saying of the ancients,&mdash;"that day which sees a man a slave takes
away half his virtue."</p>

<p>Ver. 262. <i>and heav'n on pride.</i>] This might be very well said of those times
when no one was content to go to heaven without being received there on the
footing of a god, with a ceremony of an Αποθεωσις.</p>

<p>Ver. 283. <i>'Twas then, the studious head, &amp;c.</i>] The poet seemeth here to
mean the polite and nourishing age of Greece; and those benefactors to
mankind, which he had principally in view, were Socrates and Aristotle;
who, of all the pagan world, spoke best of God, and wrote best of government.</p>

<p>Ver. 295. <i>Such is the world's great harmony, &amp;c.</i>] A harmony very different
from the pre-established harmony of the celebrated Leibnitz, which introduceth
a fatality destructive of all religion and morality. Yet hath the
learned M. de Crousaz ventured to accuse our poet of espousing that dangerous
whimsy. The pre-established harmony was built upon, and is an outrageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
extension of a conception of Plato, who, combating the atheistical objections
about the origin of evil, employs this argument in defence of Providence:
"That amongst an infinite number of possible worlds in God's idea, this
which he hath created and brought into being, and which admits of a mixture
of evil, is the best. But if the best, then evil consequently is partial, comparatively
small, and tendeth to the greater perfection of the whole." This
principle is espoused and supported by Mr. Pope with all the power of reason
and poetry. But neither was Plato a fatalist, nor is there any fatalism in the
argument. As to the truth of the notion, that is another question; and how
far it cleareth up the very difficult controversy about the origin of evil, is still
another. That it is a full solution of the difficulty, I cannot think, for reasons
too long to be given in this place. Perhaps we shall never have a full solution
here, and it may be no great matter though we have not, as we are demonstrably
certain of the moral attributes of the Deity. Yet this will never
hinder writers from exposing themselves on this subject. A late author<a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a> thinks
he can account for the origin of evil, and therefore he will write: he thinks
too, that the clearing up this difficulty is necessary to secure the foundation
of religion, and therefore he will print. But he is doubly mistaken: he must
know little of philosophy to fancy that he has found the solution; and still
less of religion, to imagine that the want of his solution can affect our belief
in God. Such writers</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Amuse th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>However, Mr. Pope may be justified in receiving and enforcing this Platonic
notion, as it hath been adopted by the most celebrated and orthodox divines
both of the ancient and modern church. This doctrine was taken up by
Leibnitz; but it was to ingraft upon it a most pernicious fatalism. Plato
said, God chose the best: Leibnitz said, he could not but choose the best, as
he could not act without, what this philosopher called, a sufficient reason.
Plato supposed freedom in God to choose one of two things equally good:
Leibnitz held the supposition to be absurd: but, however, admitting the case,
he still held that God could not choose one of two things equally good. Thus
it appears, the first went on the system of freedom; and that the latter, notwithstanding
the most artful disguises of his principles, in his Theodicée, was
a thorough fatalist: for we cannot well suppose he would give that freedom to
man which he had taken away from God. The truth of the matter seems to
be this: he saw, on the one hand, the monstrous absurdity of supposing, with
Spinoza, that blind fate was the author of a coherent universe; but yet, on
the other, he could not conceive with Plato, how God could foresee and conduct,
according to an archetypal idea, a world, of all possible worlds the best,
inhabited by free agents. This difficulty, therefore, which made the socinians
take prescience from God, disposed Leibnitz to take free-will from man: and
thus he fashioned his fantastical hypothesis; he supposed that when God
made the body, he impressed on his new-created machine a certain series or
suite of motions; and that when he made the fellow soul, he impressed a
correspondent series of ideas; whose operations, throughout the whole duration
of the union, were so exactly timed, that whenever an idea was excited, a
correspondent motion was ever ready to satisfy the volition. Thus, for instance,
when the mind had the will to raise the arm to the head, the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
was so pre-contrived, as to raise, at that very moment, the part required.
This he called the pre-established harmony; and with this he promised to do
wonders. "Yet after all," says an excellent philosopher and best interpreter
of Newton, "he owned to his friends, that this extraordinary notion was only
a lusus ingenii (un jeu d'esprit) to try his parts, and laugh at the credulity of
philosophers; who are as fond of a new paradox, as enthusiasts of a new light.
If at other times he was so pleased with his own notions in his Theodicée, as
to defend them seriously against the learned Dr. Clarke, that shows only that
he angled for two different sorts of reputation, from the same performance;
and unluckily he lost both. The subject was too serious to pass for a romance;
and the principles too absurd to be admitted for truth." <i>Mr. Baxter's Appendix
to the Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul</i>, p. 162. As this was
the case, none would have thought it amiss in M. Voltaire to oppose one
romance to another, had he rested there. But his tale of Candide, which
professes to ridicule the optimism of Leibnitz, was apparently composed in
favour of an irreligious naturalism, which he makes the solution of all the
difficulties in the story.</p>

<p>Ver. 303. <i>For forms of government, &amp;c.</i>] Such as Harrington, Wildman,
Neville,<a name="FNanchor_1598_1598" id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> &amp;c. about the several forms of a legitimate policy. These fine lines
have been strangely misunderstood. The author, against his own express
words, against the plain sense of his system, hath been conceived to mean,
that all governments and all religions were, as to their forms and objects,
indifferent. But as this wrong judgment proceeded from ignorance of the
reason of the reproof, as explained above,<a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> that explanation is alone sufficient
to rectify the mistake. However, not to leave him under the least suspicion
in a matter of so much importance, I shall justify the sense here given to this
passage, more at large:</p>

<p>I. And first, as to society: Let us consider the words themselves; and
then compare this mistaken sense with the context. The poet, we may
observe, is here speaking, not of civil society at large, but of a just legitimate
policy:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Th' according music of a well-mixed state.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now mixed states are of various kinds; in some of which the democratic, in
others the aristocratic, and in others the monarchic form prevails. Now, as
each of these mixed forms is equally legitimate, as being founded on the principles
of natural liberty, that man is guilty of the highest folly, who chooseth
rather to employ himself in a speculative contest for the superior excellence of
one of these forms to the rest, than in promoting the good administration of
that settled form to which he is subject. And yet most of our warm disputes
about government have been of this kind. Again, if by forms of government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
must needs be meant legitimate government, because that is the subject under
debate, then by modes of faith, which is the correspondent idea, must needs
be meant the modes or explanations of the true faith, because the author is
here too on the subject of true religion:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Relumed her ancient light, not kindled new.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Besides, the very expression (than which nothing can be more precise) confineth
us to understand by modes of faith, those human explanations of
christian mysteries, in contending about which zeal and ignorance have so
perpetually violated charity. Secondly, If we consider the context; to suppose
him to mean, that all forms of government are indifferent, is making
him directly contradict the preceding paragraph, where he extols the patriot
for discriminating the true from the false modes of government. He, says
the poet,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Taught pow'r's due use to people and to kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught not to slack, nor strain its tender strings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The less, or greater, set so justly true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That touching one must strike the other too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till jarring interests of themselves create<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' according music of a well mixed state.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here he recommendeth the true form of government, which is the mixed.
In another place he as strongly condemneth the false, or the absolute <i>jure
divino</i> form:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For nature knew no right divine in men.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the reader will not be displeased to see the poet's own apology, as I find
it written in the year 1740, in his own hand, in the margin of a pamphlet,
where he found these two celebrated lines very much misapplied: "The
author of these lines was far from meaning that no one form of government
is, in itself, better than another, (as, that mixed or limited monarchy, for
example, is not preferable to absolute), but that no form of government,
however excellent or preferable, in itself, can be sufficient to make a people
happy, unless it be administered with integrity. On the contrary, the best
sort of government, when the form of it is preserved, and the administration
corrupt, is most dangerous."</p>

<p>II. Again, to suppose the poet to mean, that all religions are indifferent, is
an equally wrong, as well as uncharitable suspicion. Mr. Pope, though his
subject, in this Essay on Man, confineth him to natural religion, his purpose
being to vindicate God's natural dispensations to mankind against the atheist,
yet he giveth frequent intimations of a more sublime dispensation, and even
of the necessity of it, particularly in his second Epistle, ver. 149, &amp;c., where
he confesseth the weakness and insufficiency of human reason. And likewise
in his fourth Epistle, where, speaking of the good man, the favourite of heaven,
he saith,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
For him alone, hope leads from goal to goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens still, and opens on his soul:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, lengthened on to faith, and unconfined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But natural religion never lengthened hope on to faith; nor did any religion,
but the christian, ever conceive that faith could fill the mind with happiness.
Lastly, In this very Epistle, and in this very place, speaking of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
restorers of the religion of nature, he intimates that they could only draw
God's shadow, not his image:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><span class="i0">
Relumed her ancient light, not kindled new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not God's image, yet his shadow drew:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as reverencing that truth, which telleth us, this discovery was reserved for the
"glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God." 2 Cor. iv. 4.</p>

<p>Ver. 305. <i>For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;</i>] These latter ages
have seen so many scandalous contentions for modes of faith, to the violation
of Christian charity, and dishonour of sacred Scripture, that it is not at all
strange they should become the object of so benevolent and wise an author's
resentment. But that which he here seemed to have more particularly in his
eye, was the long and mischievous squabble between Waterland and Jackson,<a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a>
on a point confessedly above reason, and amongst those adorable mysteries,
which it is the honour of our religion to find unfathomable. In this, by the
weight of answers and replies, redoubled upon one another without mercy,
they made so profound a progress, that the one proved, nothing hindered in
nature, but that the Son might have been the Father; and the other, that
nothing hindered in grace, but that the Son may be a mere creature. But if,
instead of throwing so many Greek Fathers at one another's heads, they had
but chanced to reflect on the sense of one Greek word, απειρια, that it signifies
both infinity and ignorance, this single equivocation might have saved them
ten thousand, which they expended in carrying on the controversy. However,
those mists that magnified the scene enlarged the character of the combatants,
and nobody expecting common sense on a subject where we have no ideas, the
defects of dulness disappeared, and its advantages (for, advantages it has)
were all provided for. The worst is, such kind of writers seldom know when
to have done. For writing themselves up into the same delusion with their
readers, they are apt to venture out into the more open paths of literature,
where their reputation, made out of that stuff which Lucian calls σκοτος ὁλοχροος,
presently falls from them, and their nakedness appears. And thus
it fared with our two worthies. The world, which must have always something
to amuse it, was now, and it was time, grown weary of its playthings;
and catched at a new object, that promised them more agreeable entertainment.
Tindal, a kind of bastard Socrates, had brought our speculations
from heaven to earth, and, under the pretence of advancing the antiquity
of christianity, laboured to undermine its original. This was a controversy
that required another management. Clear sense, severe reasoning, a thorough
knowledge of prophane and sacred antiquity, and an intimate acquaintance
with human nature, were the qualities proper for such as engaged in this
subject. A very unpromising adventure for these metaphysical nurslings,
bred up under the shade of chimeras. Yet they would needs venture out.<a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a>
What they got by it was only to be once well laughed at, and then, forgotten.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span></p>

<p>But one odd circumstance deserves to be remembered; though they wrote not,
we may be sure, in concert, yet each attacked his adversary at the same time;
fastened upon him in the same place; and mumbled him with just the same
toothless rage. But the ill success of this escape soon brought them to themselves.
The one made a fruitless effort to revive the old game, in a discourse
on The Importance of the Doctrine of the Trinity; and the other has been
ever since rambling in Space and Time.<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a> This short history, as insignificant
as the subjects of it are, may not be altogether unuseful to posterity. Divines
may learn by these examples to avoid the mischiefs done to religion and literature,
through the affectation of being wise above what is written, and knowing
beyond what can be understood.</p>

<p>Ver. 318. <i>And bade self-love and social be the same.</i>] True self-love is an
appetite for that proper good, for the enjoyment of which we were made as we
are. Now that good is commensurate with all other good, and a part and
portion of universal good: it is, therefore, the same with social, which hath
these properties.</p>

imagination or opinion of every man was true. 6. The Sceptic; whose absolute
doubt is, with great judgment, said to be the effect of indolence, as well
as the absolute trust of the Protagorean. For the same dread of labour
attending the search of truth, which makes the Protagorean presume it is
always at hand, makes the Sceptic conclude it is never to be found. The

<p>I reckon it for nothing that M. du Resnel saw none of the fine reasoning from
these two lines to ver. 73, in which the poet confutes both the philosophic and
popular errors concerning happiness. What I can least bear is his perverting
these two lines to a horrid and senseless fatalism, foreign to the argument in
hand, and directly contrary to the poet's general principles:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Une loi générale</span><br />
<span class="i0">Détermine toujours la cause principale;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> a general law always determines the first cause: which is the very Fate of
the ancient pagans; who supposed that the destinies gave law to the father
of gods and men. The poet says again, soon after, ver. 49, "Order is heaven's
first law," <i>i. e.</i> the first law made by God relates to order, which is a beautiful
allusion to the Scripture history of the creation, when God first appeased the
disorders of chaos, and separated the light from the darkness. Let us now
hear his translator:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">L'ordre, cet inflexible et grand législateur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui des décrets du ciel est le premier auteur.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Order, that inflexible and grand legislator, who is the first author of the law
of heaven. A proposition abominable in most senses; absurd in all.</p>

<p>Ver. 79. <i>Reason's whole pleasure, &amp;c.</i>] This is a beautiful periphrasis for
happiness; for all we feel of good is by sensation and reflection. But the
translator, who seemed little to concern himself with the poet's philosophy
or argument, mistook this description of happiness for a description of the
intellectual and sensitive faculties, opposed to one another, and therefore
turns it thus,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Le charme séducteur, dont s'enivrant les sens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Les plaisirs de l'esprit, encore plus ravissans;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And so, with the highest absurdity, not only makes the poet constitute
<i>sensual excesses</i> a part of human happiness, but likewise the product of virtue.</p>

<p>Ver. 82. <i>And peace, &amp;c.</i>] Conscious innocence, says the poet, is the only
source of internal peace; and known innocence, of external; therefore, peace
is the sole issue of virtue, or, in his own emphatic words, peace is all thy
own; a conclusive observation in his argument; which stands thus: Is
happiness rightly placed in externals? No; for it consists in health, peace,
and competence; health and competence are the product of temperance; and
peace, of perfect innocence.</p>

<p>Ver. 100. <i>See god-like Turenne</i>] This epithet has a peculiar justness, the
great man to whom it is applied not being distinguished from other generals,
for any of his superior qualities, so much as for his providential care of those
whom he led to war, in which he was so intent, that his chief purpose in
taking on himself the command of armies, seems to have been the preservation
of mankind. In this god-like care he was more remarkably employed
throughout the whole course of that famous campaign in which he lost his
life.</p>

<p>Ver. 110. <i>Lent heav'n a parent, &amp;c.</i>] This last instance of the poet's illustration
of the ways of Providence, the reader sees has a peculiar elegance, where
a tribute of piety to a parent is paid in return of thanks to, and made subservient
of his vindication of, the great Giver and Father of all things. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
mother of the author, a person of great piety and charity, died the year this
poem was finished, viz. 1733.</p>

<p>Ver. 121. <i>Think we, like some weak prince, &amp;c.</i>] Agreeable hereunto,
Holy Scripture, in its account of things under the common Providence of
heaven, never represents miracles as wrought for the sake of him who is the
object of them, but in order to give credit to some of God's extraordinary
dispensations to mankind.</p>

<p>Ver. 123. <i>Shall burning Etna, &amp;c.</i>] Alluding to the fate of those two
great naturalists, Empedocles and Pliny, who both perished by too near an
approach to Etna and Vesuvius, while they were exploring the cause of their
eruptions.</p>

<p>The joke, though lively, was ill placed, and therefore struck out of the text.</p>

<p>Ver. 177. <i>Go, like the Indian, &amp;c.</i>] Alluding to the example of the Indian,

separating them from charity, as when</p>

<p>Ver. 219. <i>Heroes are much the same, &amp;c.</i>] This character might have been
drawn with greater force; and deserved the poet's care. But Milton supplies
what is here wanting.</p>

<p>Ver. 222. <i>an enemy of all mankind!</i>] Had all nations, with regard to
their heroes, been of the humour with the Normans, who called Robert II.,
the greatest of their Dukes, by the name of Robert the Devil, the races of
heroes might have been less numerous, or, however, less mischievous.</p>

<p>Ver. 267. <i>Painful pre-eminence, &amp;c.</i>] This, to his friend, nor does it at all
contradict what he had said to him concerning happiness, in the beginning
of the Epistle:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis never to be bought, but always free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled from monarchs, St. John! dwells with thee.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For there he compliments his virtue; here he estimates the value of his
politics, which he calls wisdom. He is now proving that nothing either
external to man, or what is not in man's power, and of his own acquirement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
can make him happy here. The most plausible rival of virtue is
human wisdom: yet even this is so far from giving any degree of real
happiness, that it deprives us of those common comforts of life, which are a
kind of support, under the want of happiness. Such as the more innocent
of those delusions which he speaks of in the second Epistle,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those painted clouds that beautify our days, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now knowledge destroyeth all those comforts, by setting man above life's
weaknesses; so that in him, who thinketh to attain happiness by knowledge
alone, independent of virtue, the fable is reversed, and in a preposterous
attempt to gain the substance, he loseth even the shadow. This I take to be
the sense of this fine stroke of satire on the wrong pursuits after happiness.</p>

<p>These two instances are chosen with great judgment. The world, perhaps,
doth not afford two such other. Bacon discovered and laid down those true
principles of science, by whose assistance Newton was enabled to unfold the
whole law of nature. He was no less eminent for the creative power of his
imagination, the brightness of his conceptions, and the force of his expression;
yet being convicted on his own confession for bribery and corruption in the
administration of justice, while he presided in the supreme court of equity,
he endeavoured to repair his ruined fortunes by the most profligate flattery to
the court, which, indeed, from his very first entrance into it, he had accustomed
himself to practise with a prostitution that disgraceth the very profession
of letters or of science.</p>

<p>Cromwell seemeth to be distinguished in the most eminent manner, with
regard to his abilities, from all other great and wicked men, who have overturned
the liberties of their country. The times in which others have succeeded
in this attempt, were such as saw the spirit of liberty suppressed and
stifled by a general luxury and venality; but Cromwell subdued his country,
when this spirit was at its height, by a successful struggle against court-oppression;
and while it was conducted and supported by a set of the
greatest geniuses for government the world ever saw embarked together in
one common cause.</p>

<p>Ver. 283. <i>Or ravished with the whistling of a name,</i>] And even this fantastic
glory sometimes sutlers a terrible reverse. Sacheverel, in his Voyage
to Icolm-kill, describing the church there, tells us, that "in one corner is a
peculiar enclosure, in which were the monuments of the kings of many different
nations, as Scotland, Ireland, Norway, and the Isle of Man. This
(said the person who showed me the place, pointing to a plain stone) was the
monument of the great Teague, king of Ireland. I had never heard of him,
and could not but reflect of how little value is greatness, that has barely left
a name scandalous to a nation, and a grave which the meanest of mankind
would never envy."</p>

conclusion. He had proved, that happiness consists neither in external
goods, as the vulgar imagined, nor yet in the visions of the philosophers: he
concludes, therefore, that it consists in virtue alone. His translator says,
that without virtue, there can be no happiness. And so say the men whom
his author is here confuting. For though they supposed external goods
requisite to happiness, it was when in conjunction with virtue. Mr. Pope
says,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>These lines are extremely finished. In which there is such a soothing sweetness
in the melancholy harmony of the versification, as if the poet was then
in that tender office in which he was most officious, and in which all his soul
came out, the condoling with some good man in affliction.</p>

<p>Ver. 341. <i>For him alone, hope leads from goal to goal, &amp;c.</i>] Plato, in his
first book of a Republic, hath a remarkable passage to this purpose: "He
whose conscience does not reproach him, has cheerful hope for his companion,
and the support and comfort of his old age, according to Pindar. For this
great poet, O Socrates, very elegantly says, That he who leads a just and holy
life, has always amiable hope for his companion, which fills his heart with
joy, and is the support and comfort of his old age. Hope, the most powerful
of the divinities, in governing the ever-changing and inconstant temper of
mortal men." In the same manner Euripides speaks in his Hercules Furens:
"He is the good man in whose breast hope springs eternally. But to be
without hope in the world, is the portion of the wicked."</p>

<p>Ver. 373. <i>Come then, my friend! &amp;c.</i>] This noble apostrophe, by which
the poet concludes the Essay in an address to his friend, will furnish a critic
with examples of every one of those five species of elocution, from which, as
from its sources, Longinus deduceth the sublime.</p>

<p>1. The first and chief is a grandeur and sublimity of conception:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come then, my friend! my genius! come along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O master of the poet, and the song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the muse now stoops, and now ascends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To man's low passions, or their glorious ends.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. The second, that pathetic enthusiasm, which, at the same time, melts
and inflames:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Teach me, like thee, in various nature wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fall with dignity, with temper rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Formed by thy converse, happily to steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From grave to gay, from lively to severe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent to reason, or polite to please.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. A certain elegant formation and ordonance of figures:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! while along the stream of time thy name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Say, shall my little bark attendant sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>4. A splendid diction:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When statesmen, heroes, kings, in dust repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall then this verse to future age pretend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert my guide, philosopher, and friend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That urged by thee, I turned the tuneful art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sounds to things, from fancy to the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wit's false mirror held up nature's light.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>5. And fifthly, which includes in itself all the rest, a weight and dignity in
the composition:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shew'd erring pride, whatever is, is right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That reason, passion, answer one great aim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That true self-love and social are the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That virtue only makes our bliss below;<br /></span>

<p><i>Universal Prayer.</i>] It may be proper to observe, that some passages in the
preceding Essay, having been unjustly suspected of a tendency towards fate and
naturalism, the author composed this prayer as the sum of all, to show that
his system was founded in free-will, and terminated in piety; that the First
Cause was as well the Lord and Governor of the Universe as the Creator of it;
and that, by submission to his will (the great principle enforced throughout
the Essay), was not meant suffering ourselves to be carried along by a blind
determination, but resting in a religious acquiescence, and confidence full of
hope and immortality. To give all this the greater weight, the poet chose for
his model the Lord's Prayer, which, of all others, best deserves the title
prefixed to his paraphrase.</p>

<p>As the imparting of grace, on the Christian system, is a stronger exertion of
the divine power than the natural illumination of the heart, one would expect
that right and wrong should change places, more aid being required to restore
men to right, than to keep them in it. But as it was the poet's purpose to
insinuate that revelation was the right, nothing could better express his
purpose, than making the right secured by the guards of grace.</p>

Poets and painters must appeal
to the world at large. Wretched indeed
would be their fate, if their
merits were to be decided only by their
rivals. It is on the general opinion
of persons of taste that their individual
estimation must ultimately rest,
and if the public were excluded from
judging, poets might write and
painters paint for each other.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span>
</p>
<p>
The execution of a work and the
appreciation of it when executed are
separate operations, and all experience
has shown that numbers pronounce
justly upon literature, architecture,
and pictures, though they may not
be able to write like Shakespeare,
design like Wren, or paint like Reynolds.
Taste is acquired by studying
good models as well as by emulating
them. Pope, perhaps, copied Addison,
Tatler, Oct. 19, 1710: "It is
ridiculous for any man to criticise on
the works of another who has not
distinguished himself by his own performances."</p></div>

 "Nature," it is said in the Spectator,
No. 404, "has sometimes made
a fool, but a coxcomb is always of a
man's own making, by applying his
talents otherwise than nature designed."
The idea is expressed more
happily by Dryden in his Hind and
Panther:

 </p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
 For fools are doubly fools endeav'ring to be wise.</span></p>


<p>
Pope contradicts himself when he
says in the text that the men made
coxcombs by study were meant by
nature but for fools, since they are
among his instances of persons upon
whom nature had bestowed the "seeds
of judgment," and who possessed
"good sense" till it was "defaced by
false learning."</p></div>

<p>
"I have often thought," says the
author of the Supplement to the Profound,
speaking of Pope's couplet,
"that one pert fellow's tongue
might tire a hundred pair of attending
ears; but I never conceived that
it could communicate any lassitude
to the tongues of the bystanders
before." The evident meaning of Pope
is that it would tire a hundred ordinary
tongues to talk as much as one
vain wit, but the construction is
faulty.</p></div>

 Pope is unfortunate in his selection
of instances to illustrate his position
that the various mental faculties
are never concentrated in the
same individual. Men of great intellect
have sometimes bad memories,
and a good memory is sometimes
found in persons of a feeble intellect;
but it is a monstrous paradox to
assert that a retentive memory and a
powerful understanding cannot go
together. No one will deny that Dr.
Johnson and Lord Macaulay were
gifted with vigorous, brilliant minds;
yet the memory of the first was extraordinary,
and that of the second
prodigious. In general, men of transcendent
abilities have been remarkable
for their knowledge.</p></div>

 From the second couplet, apparently
meant to be the converse of
the first, one would suppose that he

else the counterpart is defective.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton</span>.
</p>
<p>
The structure of the passage requires
the interpretation put upon it
by Warton, in which case the language
is incorrect. The statement is
not even true of the imagination proper,
as the example of Milton would
alone suffice to prove. His imagination
was grand, and the numberless
phrases he adopted from preceding
writers evince that it was combined
with a memory unusually tenacious.</p></div>

<p>
The standard of excellence in any
art or science, must always be that
which is attained by the persons who
follow it with the greatest success;
and those who give themselves up to
a particular pursuit will, with equal
talents, eclipse the rivals who devote
to it only fragments of time. For
this reason men can rarely attain to
the highest skill in more than one
department, however many accomplishments
they may possess in a
minor degree. The native power to
shine in various callings may exist,
but the practice which can alone
make perfect, is wanting.</p></div>

to determine what is "nature," and
what is "her just standard."
"Nature" with Pope meant Homer.</p></div>

<p>
The idea was suggested by a sentence
in Sprat's Account of Cowley:
"His fancy flowed with great speed,
and therefore it was very fortunate to
him that his judgment was equal to
manage it." Pope gave a false sparkle
to his couplet by first using "wit"
in one sense and then in another.
"Wit to manage wit," says the
author of the Supplement to the Profound,
"is full as good as one tongue's
tiring another. Any one may perceive
that the writer meant that
judgment should manage wit; but
as it stands it is pert." Warburton
observes that Pope's later version
magnified the contradiction; for he
who had already "a profusion of
wit," was the last person to need
more.</p></div>

The entire passage seems to be constructed
on some remarks of Dryden
in his Dedication to Ovid: "Formerly
the critics were quite another
species of men. They were defenders
of poets, and commentators on their
works, to illustrate obscure beauties,
to place some passages in a better
light, to redeem others from malicious
interpretations. Are our auxiliary
forces turned our enemies? Are they
from our seconds become principals
against us?" The truth of Pope's
assertion, as to the matter of fact,
will not bear a rigorous inquisition,
as I believe these critical persecutors
of good poets to have been extremely
few, both in ancient and modern
times.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span></p></div>

 The prescription of the physician
was formerly called his bill. Johnson,
in his Dictionary, quotes from
L'Estrange, "The medicine was prepared
according to the bill," and
Butler, in Hudibras, speaks of

</p><div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

 This is a quibble. Time and
moths spoil books by destroying

by multiplying copies they assisted
to preserve them.</p></div>

It is a tradition preserved by Servius,
that Virgil began with writing a poem
of the Alban and Roman affairs, which
he found above his years, and descended,
first to imitate Theocritus
on rural subjects, and afterwards to
copy Homer in heroic poetry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p>
<p>
The second line of the couplet in
the note was copied, as Mr. Carruthers
points out, from Milton's
Lycidas:

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
Ph&oelig;bus replied, and touched my trembling ears.
</span></p>
<p>
The couplet in the text, with
the variation of "great Maro" for
"young Maro," was Pope's original
version, but Dennis having asked
whether he intended "to put that
figure called a bull upon Virgil" by
saying that he designed a work "to
outlast immortality," the poet wrote
in the margin of his manuscript "alter
the seeming inconsistency," which he
did, by substituting the lines in the
note. In the last edition, he reinstated
the "bull." The objection of
Dennis was hypercritical. The phrase
only expresses the double fact that
the city was destroyed, and that its
fame was durable. The manuscript
supplies another various reading,
which avoids both the alleged bull in
the text, and the bad rhyme of the
couplet in the note:</p>

 When Pope supposes Virgil to
have properly "checked in his bold
design of drawing from nature's

confined his work within rules as strict,

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">

<p>
The argument of Pope is sophistical
and inconsistent. It is inconsistent,
because if Virgil found Homer and
nature the same, his work would not
have been confined within stricter
rules when he copied Homer than
when he copied nature. It is sophistical,
because though Homer may be
always natural, all nature is not contained
in his works.</p></div>

 This couplet, in the quarto of
1743, was for the first time placed
immediately after the triplet which
ends at ver. 160. The effect of this
arrangement was that "Pegasus," instead
of the "great wits," became
the antecedent to the lines, "From
vulgar bounds," &amp;c., and the poetic
steed was said to "snatch a grace."
Warton commented upon the absurdity
of using such language of a
horse, and since it is evident that
Pope must have overlooked the incongruity,
when he adopted the transposition,
the lines were restored to
their original order in the editions of
Warton, Bowles, and Roscoe.</p></div>

 This allusion is perhaps inaccurate.
The shapeless rock, and
hanging precipice do not rise out of
nature's common order. These objects
are characteristic of some of the
features of nature, of those especially
that are picturesque. If he had said
that amid cultivated scenery we are

would have been accurate.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span>

The criticism of Bowles does not
apply to the passage in Sprat's Account
of Cowley, from which Pope
borrowed his comparison: "He knew
that in diverting men's minds there
should be the same variety observed
as in the prospects of their eyes,
where a rock, a precipice, or a rising
wave is often more delightful than a
smooth even ground, or a calm sea."</p></div>

 The poet here alludes to the four
great causes of the ravage amongst
ancient writings. The destruction of
the Alexandrine and Palatine libraries
by fire; the fiercer rage of Zoilus,

wit; the irruption of the barbarians

 "Everybody allows," says Malebranche,
"that the animal spirits are
the most subtle and agitated parts of
the blood. These spirits are carried
with the rest of the blood to the brain,
and are there separated by some organ
destined to the purpose." Pope
adopted the doctrine "allowed by
everybody," but which consisted of
assumptions without proof. The very
existence of these fluid spirits had
never been ascertained. The remaining
physiology of Pope's couplet was
erroneous. When there is a deficiency
of blood, its place is not supplied by
wind. The grammatical construction,
again, is vicious, and ascribes "blood
and spirits" to souls as well as to
bodies. The moral reflection illustrated
by the simile is but little more
correct. Men in general are not
proud in proportion as they have
nothing to be proud of.</p></div>

 Pope is commonly considered to
have laid down the general proposition
that total ignorance was preferable
to imperfect knowledge. The context
shows that he was speaking only
of conceited critics, who were presumptuous
because they were ill-informed.
He tells such persons that
the more enlightened they become
the humbler they will grow.</p></div>

 The incident is taken from the
Second Part of Don Quixote, first
written by Don Alonzo Fernandez de
Avellanada, and afterwards translated,
or rather imitated and new-modelled,
by no less an Author than
the celebrated Le Sage. "But, Sir,
quoth the Bachelor, if you would have
me adhere to Aristotle's rules, I must
omit the combat. Aristotle, replied
the Knight, I grant was a man of
some parts; but his capacity was not
unbounded; and, give me leave to
tell you, his authority does not extend
over combats in the list, which
are far above his narrow rules. Believe
me the combat will add such
grace to your play, that all the rules
in the universe must not stand in competition
with it. Well, Sir Knight,
replied the Bachelor, for your sake,
and for the honour of chivalry, I will
not leave out the combat. But still
one difficulty remains, which is, that
our common theatres are not large
enough for it. There must be one
erected on purpose, answered the
Knight; and in a word, rather than
leave out the combat, the play had
better be acted in a field or plain."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

 The conventionalities of foppery
and ceremony are always changing,
and what Pope says of manners may
have been extensively true of his own
generation. At present bad manners
commonly proceed either from defective
sensibility, or from men having
more regard to themselves than to
their company.</p></div>

 This had been the practice of
some artists. "Their heroes," says
Reynolds, speaking of the French
painters in 1752, "are decked out so
nice and fine that they look like
knights-errant just entering the lists
at a tournament in gilt armour, and
loaded most unmercifully with silk,
satin, velvet, gold, jewels, &amp;c." Pope
had in his mind a passage of Cowley's
Ode on Wit:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Yet 'tis not to adorn, and gild each part;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That shows more cost than art.</span><br />

erroneous; he depresses it below

</p>
<p>
The error was in stating a partial
as an universal truth; for the second
line of the couplet correctly describes
the quality which gives the charm to
numberless passages both in prose and
verse. Instead of "ne'er so well,"
the reading of the first edition was
"ne'er before," which was not equally
true. But Pope followed the passage
in Boileau, from which the line in
the Essay on Criticism was derived:
"Qu'est-ce qu'une pensée neuve, brillante,
extraordinaire? Ce n'est point,
comme se le persuadent les ignorants,
une pensée que personne n'a jamais
eu, ni dû avoir. C'est au contraire
une pensée qui a dû venir à tout le
monde, et que quelqu'un s'avise le
premier d'exprimer. Un bon mot
n'est bon mot qu'en ce qu'il dit une
chose que chacun pensoit, et qu'il la
dit d'une manière vive, fine et nouvelle."</p></div>

 Two lines, which follow in the

worth quoting as a curiosity, since

the worst that were ever written:</p>

 "Let us," says Mr. Webb, in a
passage quoted by Warton, "substitute
the definition in the place of the
thing, and it will stand thus: 'A work
may have more of nature dressed to
advantage than will do it good.'
This is impossible, and it is evident
that the confusion arises from the
poet having annexed different ideas
to the same word."</p></div>

 "Take upon content" for "take

<p>
Vowels were said to open on each
other when two words came together
of which the first ended, and the
second commenced with a vowel.
Pope has illustrated the fault by
crowding three consecutive instances
into his verse. The poets diminished
the conflict of vowels by a free recourse
to elisions. The most usual
were the cutting off the "e" in
"the," as "th' unlearned," ver. 327;
and the "o" in "to," as "t' outlast,"
ver. 131, "t' examine," ver.
134, "t' admire," ver. 200. The
two words were thus fused into one,
and the old authors combined them
in writing as well as in the pronunciation.
The manuscripts of Chaucer
have "texcuse," not "t' excuse;"
"thapostle," not "th' apostle." The
custom has not kept its ground.
Whatever might be supposed to be
gained in harmony by the conversion
of "to examine" into "texamine,"
or of "the unlearned" into "thunlearned"
was more than lost by the
departure from the common forms of
speech.</p></div>

it arises from a correspondence of
subject is highly meritorious. Let a
single example from Milton suffice:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,<br />
Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens and shades of death.
</div></div></div>
<p>

How successfully does this range of
little words represent to our imaginations,

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
The growing labours of the lengthened way.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span>
</span></p>
<p>
"It is pronounced by Dryden,"
says Johnson, "that a line of monosyllables
is almost always harsh. This
is evidently true, because our monosyllables
commonly begin and end
with consonants." As Dryden expressed
it, "they are clogged with
consonants," and "it seldom," he
says, "happens but a monosyllable
line turns verse to prose, and even that
prose is rugged and inharmonious."
The authority of Dryden has led
many persons to mistrust their own
ears, and imagine, like Johnson and
Wakefield, that monosyllables were
only fitted at best to produce some
special effect. Numerous examples
in Dryden's poetry contradict his
criticism, and Milton abounds in
sweet and sonorous monosyllabic
lines, as Par. Lost, v. 193:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow<br />
Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye pines,<br />
With ev'ry plant, in sign of worship wave.
</div></div></div>
<p>

And ver. 199:

</p><div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">ye birds,</span><br />
That singing up to heaven gate ascend,<br />
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
</div></div></div>
<p>
Melodious lines, such as the first
verse in the first of these passages,
which have the monosyllables relieved
but by a single dissyllable, are
past counting up. Addison praised
Pope for exemplifying the faults in
the language which condemned them.
"The gaping of the vowels in the
second line, the expletive 'do' in the
third line, and the ten monosyllables
in the fourth, give such a beauty
to this passage, as would have been
very much admired in an ancient
poet." The feat was too easy to call
for much admiration. There was
more difficulty in eschewing than in
mimicking the vicious style of bad
versifiers. Pope himself has not
avoided the frequent use of "low
words" and "feeble expletives."</p></div>

 Writers who seem to have composed
with the greatest ease have exerted
much labour in attaining this
facility. It is well known that the
writings of La Fontaine were laboured
into that facility for which they are
so famous, with repeated alterations
and many erasures. Moliere is reported
to have passed whole days in
fixing upon a proper epithet or rhyme,
although his verses have all the flow
and freedom of conversation. I have
been informed that Addison was so
extremely nice in polishing his prose
compositions that when almost a
whole impression of a Spectator was
worked off he would stop the press to
insert a new preposition or conjunction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

 Our poet here endeavours to fasten
on Virgil a most insufferable absurdity,
which no poetical hyperbole
will justify, namely, the reality of
these wonderful performances, a flight
over the unbending corn, and across
the sea with unbathed feet. Virgil
only puts the supposition, and speaks
of her extraordinary velocity in the
way of comparison, that she seemed
capable of accomplishing so much
had she made the attempt. She
could fly, if she had chosen, nor
would have injured, in that case, the
tender blades of corn.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span></p></div>

 The verse intended to represent
the whisper of the vernal breeze must
surely be confessed not much to excel
in softness or volubility; and the
smooth stream runs with a perpetual
clash of jarring consonants. The noise
and turbulence of the torrent is, indeed,
distinctly imaged; for it requires
very little skill to make our
language rough. But in the lines
which mention the effort of Ajax,
there is no particular heaviness or
delay. The swiftness of Camilla is
rather contrasted than exemplified.
Why the verse should be lengthened
to express speed, will not easily be
discovered. In the dactyls, used for
that purpose by the ancients, two
short syllables were pronounced with
such rapidity, as to be equal only to
one long; they therefore naturally
exhibit the act of passing through
a long space in a short time. But
the Alexandrine, by its pause in the
midst, is a tardy and stately measure;
and the word "unbending," one of
the most sluggish and slow which
our language affords, cannot much
accelerate its motion.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span>

Aaron Hill says, that Pope was very
fond of the line in the text, and
often repeated it. Hill, who "abhorred
the sentiment," once asked him if he
still adhered to the opinion of Longinus,
that the true sublime thrilled
and transported the reader. On Pope
replying in the affirmative, his interrogator
pressed him with the contradiction,
and the perplexed poet,
according to Hill's report, took refuge
in nonsense, and made this
unintelligible answer,&mdash;"that Longinus's
remark was truth, but that, like
certain truths of more importance, it
required assent from faith, without
the evidence of demonstration." It
must be evident that Shakespeare,
Milton, and scores besides, are worthy
of admiration; and no man would
show his sense by protesting that he
did not admire but only approved of
them. Pope is inconsistent, for at
ver. 236 he speaks of "<i>rapture</i>
warming the mind," and of "the
generous pleasure to be <i>charmed</i> with wit."</p></div>

 This was directed against Pope's
co-religionists, and greatly annoyed
them. The offence was not that he
had misrepresented their views, but
that he had denounced a doctrine
which all zealous papists maintained.
"Nothing," he said, when writing
in vindication of the passage to
Caryll, "has been so much a scarecrow
to our opponents as that too
peremptory and uncharitable assertion
of an utter impossibility of salvation
to all but ourselves. I own to
you I was glad of any opportunity
to express my dislike of so shocking
a sentiment as those of the religion
I profess are commonly charged with,
and I hoped a slight insinuation, introduced
by a casual similitude only,
could never have given offence, but on
the contrary, must needs have done
good in a nation wherein we are the
smaller party, and consequently most
misrepresented, and most in need of
vindication." The Roman Catholics
took to themselves the couplet
"Meanly they seek," which followed
the simile, but Pope pointed out that
the plural "some," and not the singular
"each man," was the antecedent
to "they." The comparison was
not kept up throughout the paragraph,
and the lines after ver. 397
refer solely to the critics.</p></div>

 In the first edition the reading
was "dull believers," which Pope in
the second edition altered to "plain."
The change was occasioned by the
outcry against the couplet. "An
ordinary man," he wrote to Caryll,
"would imagine the author plainly
declared against these schismatics
for quitting the true faith out of contempt
of the understanding of some
few of its believers. But these believers
are called 'dull,' and because
I say that these schismatics think
some believers dull, therefore these
charitable well-disposed interpreters
of my meaning say that I think all
believers dull." There is a culpable
levity in the language of Pope's lines,
but he could not intend to espouse
the cause of the sceptics when he
selects them as an instance of people
who "purposely go wrong" because
"the crowd go right."</p></div>

but not for the same reason that weak
heads changed their opinions.</p></div>

The lines between brackets are from
the manuscript, and were not printed

of May, 1711, where the anagrams,
acrostics, and punning sermons of the
reign of James I. are all enumerated.
Swiney was the director of the Italian

1700, called a Satire against Wit.
The author treats wit as money, and
proposes that the whole should be
recoined for the purpose of separating
the base metal from the pure.</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Into the melting pot when Dryden comes<br />
What horrid stench will rise, what noisome fumes!<br />
How will he shrink when all his lewd allay<br />
And wicked mixture shall be purged away!<br />
When once his boasted heaps are melted down,<br />
A chestful scarce will yield one sterling crown.
</div></div></div>
<p>
This is exaggerated, but the censure
is directed against the indecency
which was really infamous. The
invectives of Milbourne in his Notes
on Dryden's Virgil, 1698, had not
the same excuse. The strictures are
confined to the translation of the
Eclogues and Georgics, and are
throughout rabid, insolent, coarse,
and contemptible. To demonstrate
his own superiority, Milbourne inserted
specimens of a rival translation,
which is on a par with his
criticisms. He was in orders, and
acknowledges that one of his reasons
for not sparing Dryden was that
Dryden never spared a clergyman.
"I am only," replied the poet, with
exquisite sarcasm, "to ask pardon of
good priests, and am afraid his part
of the reparation will come to little."
Dryden retaliated upon both antagonists
together in the couplet,</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Wouldst thou be soon dispatched, and perish whole?<br />
Trust Maurus with thy life, and Milbourne with thy

Pope's line in the first edition was

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New Bl&mdash;&mdash;s and new M&mdash;&mdash;s must arise.</span>
</div></div></div>
<p>
In the second edition he substituted
S&mdash;&mdash;s, which meant Shadwells,
for Bl&mdash;&mdash;s, but in the quarto of 1717
he again coupled Blackmore with
Milbourne, and printed both names
at full length. Blackmore was living,
and the changes indicate Pope's varying
feelings towards him.</p></div>

presenting to him his virulent and

of which, it is said, the king ordered

 His instance refuted his position
that "bare threescore" was the duration
of modern fame. "It is now
a hundred years," said Dennis in
1712, "since Shakespeare began to
write, more since Spenser flourished,
and above three hundred years since
Chaucer died. And yet the fame of
none of these is extinguished." Another
century and a half has elapsed,
and the reputation of Chaucer, Spenser,
and Shakespeare is greater than
ever. The notion of the "failing
language" is not more sound. Though
it is a hundred and fifty years since
the Essay on Criticism was published,
there is not a line which has
an antiquated air.</p></div>

 In the previous paragraph Pope
admitted that the fame of a modern
might last three-score years.
Here, contradicting himself and the
facts, he limits its duration to the
youth of the author. He applies to
poets in general what was only true
of inferior writers. The ephemeral
versifiers were examples of deficient
"wit," and not of the unhappy consequences
of genuine poetic power.</p></div>

 Wakefield objects to the "slovenly
superfluity of words," and asks "to

meant the wife of the owner of the

Against this Pope wrote, "To be

said Dennis, "can wit be scorned

wants this wit may indeed be scorned,

honour that the contemner has for
wit." Pope, in a letter to Caryll,

The feelings of antiquity were
doubtless represented truly by Horace
when he said that indifferent poets

There is not the least foundation for
Pope's statement that it was the habit

commendations on their abortive industry

 Pepys, under the date of June 12,
1663, notices that wearing masks at
the theatre had "of late become a
great fashion among the ladies."
Cibber states that the immorality of
the plays was the cause of the usage.
When he wrote in 1739 the custom
had been abolished for many years
in consequence of the ill effects which
attended it.</p></div>

There was no use for the "modest
fan" at the theatre after the ladies
had adopted the more effectual plan
of wearing masks. Pope, ver. 535,
ascribes the introduction of "obscenity"
to the Restoration. In the
theatre the grossness was a legacy
from the older drama, and particularly
from the plays of Beaumont
and Fletcher, which were the most
popular pieces on the stage.</p></div>

Burman, Kuster, and Wasse with a
contempt which recoiled upon himself.
To the second we will impute
his pious zeal against those divines
of king William, whom he supposed
to be infected with the infidel, or the
socinian, or the latitudinarian spirit,
and not so orthodox as himself, and
his friends Swift, Bolingbroke, etc.

 Jortin asserted that by the "unbelieving
priests" Pope alluded to
Burnet. If Jortin is right, the passage
was not satire but falsehood.
That there was, however, much infidelity
and socinianism during the
reign of William III. is proved by
an address of the House of Commons
to the king, quoted by Bowles,
"beseeching his majesty to give
effectual orders for suppressing all pernicious
books and pamphlets which
contained impious doctrines against
the Holy Trinity, and other fundamental
articles of the protestant
faith, tending to the subversion of
the christian religion." This address
was presented in February 1698.</p></div>

It is still a disputed point whether
jaundice ever affects the eye in a degree
to permit only the passage of
the yellow rays. The instances are

Dennis objected that a man when

assurance," and Pope wrote on the

</p>
<p>
Pope's maxim was commended by
Franklin. He found that his overbearing,
dictatorial manner roused
needless opposition, and he resolved
never "to use a word that imported
a fixed opinion," but he employed
instead the qualifying phrases, "I
conceive," "I imagine," or "it so
appears to me at present." "To
this," he says, "after my character
of integrity, I think it principally
owing that I had early so much
weight with my fellow citizens when
I proposed new institutions or alterations
in the old; for I was but a bad
speaker, subject to much hesitation,
and yet I generally carried my point."
He admits that his humility was
feigned. Had it been real there would
have been no need for "I conceive,"
"I imagine," which are implied without
a tiresome, superfluous repetition.
Unless the dogmatism is in the mind
opinions have not the tone of decrees.</p></div>

 Warton praises Pope for practising
the precept in correcting the
poems of Wycherley, and condemned
Wycherley for ungenerously resenting
the candour of his critic. Bowles
extenuates the conduct of Wycherley,
and says that "the superannuated
bard" bore the corrections with "great
temper till Pope seriously advised
him to turn the whole into prose."
Warton and Bowles were deceived
by the printed correspondence of Pope
and Wycherley, and were not aware
that the letters were garbled in the very
particulars which relate to the cause
of the quarrel,&mdash;a quarrel so discreditable
to Pope that he had recourse
to forgery to shield himself and throw
the blame upon Wycherley. It is
certain that "the superannuated
bard" did not take offence at the
advice to turn his works into prose,
and there is no reason to doubt the
contemporaneous report that his anger
arose from discovering that Pope,
while professing unlimited friendship,
had made him the subject of
some satirical verses.</p></div>

edition of 1743, when Dennis had
been some years dead. "His book
against me," the poet wrote to Caryll,
Nov. 19, 1712, "made me very
heartily merry in two minutes' time,"
and here we find him still smarting
with resentment after thirty years
and upwards had gone by, and his
enemy was in the grave. The original
reading in the manuscript of ver. 585
was "But D&mdash;&mdash; reddens." The
substituted name is taken from Dennis's
tragedy of "Appius and Virginia,"
which appeared in 1709. The
stare was one of his characteristics.
"He starts, stares, and looks round
him at every jerk of his person forward,"
says Sir Richard Steele, when
describing his walk. The "tremendous"
was not only a sarcasm on his
appearance, but on his partiality for
the epithet, which was an old topic of
ridicule. "If," said Gildon, in 1702,
"there is anything of tragedy in the
piece, it lies in the word 'tremendous,'
for he is so fond of it he had
rather use it in every page than slay
his beloved Iphigenia." Gay, in 1712,
jeeringly dedicated his Mohocks to
Mr. D[ennis], and assigned, among
the reasons for the selection, that his
theme was "horrid and tremendous."</p></div>

 Pope may have derived this comparison
from the "Epilogue, written
by a person of honour," to Dryden's
Secret Love:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

The author of the Epilogue was
more exact than Pope, whose application
of the simile is inaccurate, for
the top is in full spin when it is
popularly said to be asleep.</p></div>

Whom else could the lines suit at
that period, when Pope says, "Such

so much kindness, and who

<p>
The application was too obvious
for Pope to have ventured on the lines
unless he had designed to expose his

of ver. 610 in the manuscript was,</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>
<p>
And the alteration turned an unappropriated
description into a particular
censure on living men. Wycherley
would be the last person to detect
the likeness, and relaxing, some
months after the Essay appeared, in
his indignation against Pope, "he
praised the poem," according to a
letter of Cromwell, dated Oct. 26,
1711, but which rests on the authority
of Pope alone.</p></div>

 A common slander at that time

The accusation from which he defended
Garth was brought against
Pope himself. "This poem," says
Johnson, of Cooper's Hill, "had
such reputation as to excite the common
artifice by which envy degrades
excellence. A report was spread that
the performance was not Denham's
own, but that he had bought it of a
vicar for forty pounds. The same
attempt was made to rob Addison of
his Cato and Pope of his Essay on
Criticism." The story told was that
Wycherley sent the Essay to Pope for
his revision, and that Pope published
it as his own. Authors are not the
only persons who are exposed to such
calumnies. The victories of a great
general are almost invariably imputed
to some subordinate officer, and
it was long a favourite theory of the
malignant that Napoleon owed his
successes to Berthier, and the Duke
of Wellington to Sir George Murray.</p></div>

 The propriety of the specification
in this proverbial remark is founded
on a circumstance no longer existing
in our poet's time, and derived, therefore,
by him from older writers. "In
the reigns of James I. and Charles I.,"
says Pennant, "the body of St.
Paul's cathedral was the common
resort of the politicians, the newsmongers,
and the idle in general. It
was called Paul's Walk, and the frequenters
known by the name of Paul's
walkers."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span></p></div>

</p>
<p>
Boileau tells the incident of an
individual poetaster. Pope generalises
the exceptional trait, and represents
it to have been the usual practice of
foppish critics to talk criticism at the
altar. The probability is that he had
never known an instance. The line
"For fools rush in," is certainly

 "Before he goes ten lines further,"
said Dennis, "he forgets himself,
and commends Longinus for the
very contrary quality for which he
commended Horace. He commends
Horace for judging coolly in verse, and
extols Longinus for criticising with
fire in prose." With very little faith
in the traits he had ascribed to
Horace, Pope was tempted in the
manuscript to reverse the characteristic,
and write

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
He judged with spirit as he sung with fire.
</span></p>
<p>
He subsequently affixed to the

</p>
<p>
The construction of the last line is
deplorably faulty. "Horace does not
suffer more by wits than he suffers
by critics" is Pope's meaning, but
interpreted by his language, he would
be read as asserting that Horace did
not suffer more by wrong translations
than critics suffered by wrong quotations.</p></div>

The lines first appeared in the
second edition. In a pretended letter
to Addison, dated October 10, 1714,
Pope speaks of having found a particular
remark in one of the treatises
of the Greek critic, but he had probably
never looked into the original
when this couplet was written, and
seems to have falsely inferred from
chance quotations that the comments
upon Homer were the special characteristic
of the works of Dionysius.
Pope was indebted for the leading
phrase in his couplet to a passage of
Rochester, quoted by Wakefield:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

It is to be suspected that Pope had
never read Petronius, and mentioned
him on the credit of two or three
sentences which he had often seen
quoted, imagining that where there
was so much, there must necessarily
be more. Young men, in haste to
be renowned, too frequently talk of
books which they have scarcely seen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span>
</p>
<p>
If Pope had been acquainted with
the general tenor of the fragments
which remain of Petronius, he would
not have celebrated the most corrupt
and disgusting writer of antiquity for
an unalloyed combination of charming
qualities.</p></div>

The taste and sensibility of Longinus
were exquisite; but his observations
are too general, and his method
too loose. The precision of the true
philosophical critic is lost in the
declamation of the florid rhetorician.
Instead of showing for what reason a
sentiment or image is sublime, and
discovering the secret power by which
they affect a reader with pleasure,
he is ever intent on producing something
sublime himself, and strokes of
his own eloquence.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

 This verse is ungrammatical.
With respect to the thought, Boileau,
whose translation of Longinus our
poet had most probably read, has
said, in his preface to that work,
exactly the same thing: "Souvent
il fait la figure qu'il enseigne; et,
en parlant du sublime, il est lui-même
très-sublime." Pope's couplet
seems indebted also to the Prologue of
Dryden's Tempest, speaking of Shakespeare:</p>

 "Rome," as invariably pronounced
by Pope's contemporaries
had the same sound with "doom,"
and the pronunciation is not quite
obsolete in our own time among
persons who were born in the last
century. In the previous part of the
poem he had made Rome rhyme to
"dome," which itself was often pronounced
like "doom."</p></div>

 "The superstition of some ages
after the subversion of the Roman
Empire," wrote Pope to Caryll, July
19, 1711, "is too manifest a truth to
be denied, and does in no sort reflect
upon the present catholics, who are
free from it. Our silence on these
points may, with some reason, make
our adversaries think we allow and
persist in those bigotries, which in
reality all good and sensible men
despise, though they are persuaded
not to speak against them." Most
of Pope's associates were men of
letters or men of the world, and he
could know little of the spirit of the
church to which he nominally belonged,
when he was simple enough
to believe that the Romanists of his
day would sanction a sweeping denunciation
of the ignorance and superstition
of the monks.</p></div>

Pope told Caryll that he did not

only learning concerned in the subject

confessed his belief that the learning
which the monks possessed "was
barely kept alive by them." The explanation

conciliate the offended catholics.</p></div>

Pope avowed his conviction to Caryll
that the priests had openly accused

of his poem, because they were secretly
exasperated at his eulogy upon
Erasmus. "What in their own opinion,"
he said, "they are really angry
at is that a man whom their tribe
oppressed and persecuted should be
vindicated after a whole age of obloquy
by one of their own people, who is
free and bold enough to utter a generous
truth in behalf of the dead, whom
no man sure will flatter, and few do
justice to."</p></div>

 May I be pardoned for declaring
it as my opinion, that Boileau's is
the best Art of Poetry extant? The
brevity of his precepts, the justness
of his metaphors, the harmony of his
numbers, as far as Alexandrine lines
will admit, the exactness of his
method, the perspicacity of his remarks,
and the energy of his style,
all duly considered, may render this
opinion not unreasonable. It is
scarcely to be conceived, how much
is comprehended in four short cantos.
He that has well digested these, cannot
be said to be ignorant of any
important rule of poetry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Boileau is said by Pope to sway in
right of Horace because the Frenchman
avowed that he based his Art of
Poetry on that of the Roman. The
English poet has been indebted to
both.</p></div>

 Essay on Poetry, by the Duke of
Buckingham. Our poet is not the
only one of his time who complimented
this Essay and its noble
author. Mr. Dryden had done it
very largely in the Dedication to his
Translation of the Æneid; and Dr.
Garth, in the first edition of his Dispensary,
says:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
The Tyber now no courtly Gallus sees,<br />
But smiling Thames enjoys his Normanbys;<br />
</div></div></div>
<p>
though afterwards omitted, when parties
were carried so high in the reign
of Queen Anne, as to allow no commendation
to an opposite in politics.
The duke was all his life a steady
adherent to the church of England
party, yet an enemy to the extravagant
measures of the court in the
reign of Charles II. On which account,
after having strongly patronized
Mr. Dryden, a coolness succeeded
between them on that poet's absolute
attachment to the court, which carried
him some length beyond what the
duke could approve of. This nobleman's
true character had been very
well marked by Mr. Dryden before:

</p><div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

Our author was more happy; he was
honoured very young with his friendship,
and it continued till his death
in all the circumstances of a familiar
esteem.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p>
<p>
The Duke of Buckingham, in his
Essay, has followed the method of
Boileau, in discoursing on the various
species of poetry in their different
gradations, to no other purpose than
to manifest his own inferiority. His
reputation was owing to his rank. In
reading his poems one is apt to
exclaim with our author, "What
woeful stuff this madrigal would be,"
&amp;c.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Pope must have been well aware
that, amongst all the poetic triflers
of the day, there was not one more
ripe for the Dunciad. The fact, I
fear, is that Pope admired him, in
spite of his verses, as a man rich and
prosperous.&mdash;<span class="smcap">De Quincey.</span>
</p>
<p>
The couplet in which the duke is
mentioned was first inserted in the
quarto of 1717, and the note on him
in the edition of 1743. In the original
manuscript Pope had made the
same character serve for him and Lord
Roscommon:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Such learn'd and modest, not more great than good,<br />
With manners gen'rous as his noble blood,<br />
E'er saints impatient snatched him to the sky,<br />

 An Essay on translated Verse
seems, at first sight, to be a barren
subject; yet Roscommon has decorated
it with many precepts of utility
and taste. It is indisputably better
written, in a closer and more vigorous
style, than the last-mentioned
essay.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
When Warton wrote, some traditional
reputation still lingered round
the poems of Roscommon. His
feeble platitudes are now forgotten.</p></div>

 Walsh was in general a flimsy
and frigid writer. The Rambler calls
his works pages of inanity. His three
letters to Pope, however, are well
written. His remarks on the nature
of pastoral poetry, on borrowing from
the ancients, and against florid conceits,
are worthy perusal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
In the manuscript, the eulogy on
Walsh was at first somewhat different:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Such late was Walsh&mdash;nor can'st thou, Muse, offend,<br />
Next these to name the Muse's judge and friend;<br />
Who free from envious censure, partial praise,<br />
Showed ancient candour in malicious days<br />
To frailties mild, &amp;c.<br />
</div></div></div>
<p>
The Muse did offend notwithstanding.
After speaking of the irritation
he excited by his commendations of
Erasmus, Pope thus continued in his
letter to Caryll of July 19, 1711:&mdash;"Others,
you know, were as angry
that I mentioned Mr. Walsh with
honour, who as he never refused to
any one of merit of any party the
praise due to him, so honestly deserved
it from all others of never
so different interests or sentiments."
The objections seem to have come
from the Roman Catholics, and to
have been made on religious or political
grounds, from which it may be
inferred that Walsh was an active opponent
of the exiled family. Neither
the laudation of Dryden, who said he
was "the best critic of our nation,"
nor the poetical tribute of Pope, could
do more than preserve the bare name
of an author whose literary qualifications
were of the most trivial kind.
Dennis, who was acquainted with him,
and who admits that he was an indifferent
poet, adds that "he was
learned, candid and judicious, and a
man of a very good understanding in
spite of his being a beau." He was a
country gentlemen of fortune, and a
member of parliament, which were the
principal circumstances that conferred
lustre upon his small talents in the
eyes of the wits.</p></div>

 Pope fell into the prevalent vice
of uttering extravagant, insincere
compliments; for it is impossible to
believe that he "no more attempted
to rise" in verse because he had lost
the guidance of Walsh. The guide
had not done much towards directing
Pope's flight, and "teaching him to
sing." The Pastorals were his only
work, antecedent to the Essay on
Criticism, which had a nominal originality,
and three of these Pastorals
were written before he and Walsh
were acquainted.</p></div>

 The hint for the first verse in this
couplet seems to have been supplied
by Dryden's conclusion of the Religio
Laici:

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
Yet neither praise expect, nor censure fear.
</span></p>
<p>
The second verse of the couplet
seems to be an adaptation of a line in
Prior's Henry and Emma:

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
Joyful to live yet not afraid to die.

 Warburton's remarks on the quotation from Addison's paper in the Spectator, originally
ran thus: "Whereas nothing can be more unlike, in this respect, than these two poems&mdash;the
Essay on Criticism having, as we shall show, all the regularity that method can
demand, and the Art of Poetry all the looseness and inconnection that a familiar conversation
would indulge. Neither, were it otherwise, would this excellent author's observation
excuse our poet, who, writing in the formal way of a discourse, was obliged to observe
the method of such compositions, while Horace in an easy epistle needed no apology for
want of it. For it is the nature of the composition that makes method proper or
unnecessary." The passage was altered out of compliment to the commentary of his
friend Hurd on the Art of Poetry, and Warburton, who had previously contended that
method was needless in Horace, now maintained that there was no "prerogative in verse
to dispense with regularity." It was common with him to regulate his critical opinions
by his personal partialities or aversions.</p></div>

 When Warburton published his Shakespeare in 1747, Edwards exposed, in his Canons

 The work which Warburton vaunts as the only honest piece of modern criticism, was

 Dennis's Remarks on the Rape of the Lock were written in 1714, and published
in 1728. "To cure the little gentleman of his wretched conceitedness, by
giving him a view of his ignorance, his folly, and his natural impotence,"
Dennis, in 1717, brought out a critical pamphlet on three of his works, and kept
back the exposure of the Rape of the Lock "<i>in terrorem</i>, which had so good an
effect, that the author endeavoured for a time to counterfeit humility, and a sincere
repentance, but no sooner did he believe that time had caused these things to
be forgot, than he relapsed into ten times the folly and the madness that ever he
had shown before." The fresh provocation was the Dunciad, and the treatise
on the Profound, and poor Dennis printed his awe-inspiring Remarks on the
Rape of the Lock, to give "the little gentleman" another lesson in humility.</p></div>

 In his Observations on the Poetic character of Pope, Bowles reiterates that the
Rape of the Lock is "a composition to which it will be in vain to compare anything
of the kind,&mdash;that it stands alone, unrivalled, and possibly never to be
rivalled." "The Muse," he adds, "has no longer her great characteristic attributes,
pathos or sublimity; but she appears so interesting that we almost doubt
whether the garb of elegant refinement is not as captivating, as the most beautiful
appearances of nature."</p></div>

 "In mock heroic poems," said Addison, Spectator, No. 523, "the use of
the heathen mythology is not only excusable but graceful, because it is the
design of such compositions to divert by adapting the fabulous machines of the
ancients to low subjects, and at the same time by ridiculing such kinds of
machinery in modern writers." Pope's projected machinery was not to be
burlesque, and did not come under Addison's exception.</p></div>

 Pope's Correspondence, vol. i. p. 400. The disclaimer of Addison is in a
letter which he directed Steele to write to Lintot. Steele says that the pamphlet
"was offered to be communicated" to Addison before it was published, and
Dennis concluded that the offer came from Pope. It doubtless came from the bookseller,
for Pope was anxious to preserve his incognito. He assured Cromwell and
Caryll, that he was not the author, and to have avowed the satire would have
betrayed his double-dealing to Lintot, and proclaimed to the public that the
rancour towards Dennis was dictated by revenge. When the Narrative of Dennis's
Frenzy was offered to Addison, he answered, that "he could not in honour and
conscience be privy to such treatment, and was sorry to hear of it." If this
reply was communicated to Pope, zeal for Addison could not be the motive for
persevering in a publication which was thoroughly distasteful to him, let alone
the absurdity of the supposition that Addison's interests could have weighed with
the person who had instigated the attack. Accordingly, Pope in his pamphlet
scoffed at Dennis, but did not reply to his criticisms upon Cato.</p></div>

 Pope never, I think, is so unsuccessful
as when he is writing to the
ladies. He talks of the impropriety
of using hard words before a lady.
He must bring "her acquainted with
the Rosicrucians," and explain what
is meant by "machinery." This is
done with such an air of conceited
superiority, and of affected condescension,
that it appears to me as pedantic
as the pedantry he pretended to despise.
The latter part of the epistle
is certainly urbane, elegant and unaffected.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

25, 1714, when the poem was about
to be published in its enlarged shape,
"I was strangely tempted to have
set your name at length, as well as I
have my own; but I remembered the
desire you formerly expressed to the
contrary, besides that it may better
become me to appear as the offerer of
an ill present, than you as the receiver
of it."</p></div>

 "Belinda was Mrs. Arabella
Fermor; the Baron was Lord Petre,
of small stature, who soon after
married a great heiress, Mrs. Warmsley,
and died, leaving a posthumous
son; Thalestris was Mrs. Morley; Sir

Brown, of Berkshire." Copied from
a MS. in a book presented by R. Lord
Burlington, to Mr. William Sherwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>

All these persons were Roman Catholics.
The marriage of Lord Petre
to Miss Warmsley took place in March,
1712, and he died the year after in
March, 1713, at the age of 22. Miss
Fermor married Mr. Perkins, of Ufton

Pope probably altered the couplet
in consequence of an objection of the
author of the Supplement to the Profound,
who remarked upon the mean
effect which resulted from throwing
the rhyme upon "then;" "for the
rhyme," says Dr. Trapp, "draws out
the sound of little and ignoble words,
and makes them observed."</p></div>

 Belinda rung a hand-bell, which
not being answered, she knocked with
her slipper. Bell-hanging was not
introduced into our domestic apartments
till long after the date of the
Rape of the Lock. There are no
bells at Hampton Court, nor were
there any in the first quarter of the
present century at Chatsworth and
Holkham. <a name="I_myself_about_the" id="I_myself_about_the">
I myself, about the year
1790</a>, remember that it was still
the practice for ladies to summon
their attendants to their bedchambers
by knocking with a high-heeled shoe.
Servants, too, were accustomed to
wait in ante-rooms, whence they were
summoned by hand-bells, and this
explains the extraordinary number of
such rooms in the houses of the last
century.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Croker.</span></p></div>

<p>
And, as Mr. Croker observes, Pope,
in adding them, did not perceive that
he introduced an inconsistency. At
ver. 14 Belinda is represented as
waking, and at ver. 20 we have her
still sleeping.</p></div>

 The frequenters of the court appeared
in clothes of unusual splendour
on the birth-day of King, Queen,

 "The silver token" alludes to the
silver pennies which fairies were said to
drop at night into the shoes of maids
who kept the house clean and tidy.
"The circled green" refers to those
rings of grass of a deeper hue than
the surrounding pasture, which were
formerly believed to be caused by the
midnight dances "of airy elves."
This was the lore taught by the nurse.

The box at the theatre, and the
ring in Hyde Park, are frequently
mentioned as the two principal places
for the public display of beauty and
fashion. Thus Lord Dorset, in his
lines on Lady Dorchester:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

Wilt thou still sparkle in the box<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or ogle in the ring.</span><br />

And Garth, in the Dispensary, speaking
of a deceased young lady, says:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

Blaze in the box, and sparkle in the ring.<br />

In Le Comte de Gabalis the salamanders
who dwelt in fire, the
nymphs who peopled the seas and
rivers, the gnomes who filled the
earth almost to the centre, and
the sylphs who in countless multitudes
floated in the air, are said to
be formed of the purest portion of
the elements they respectively inhabit.
But their moral and mental
natures are not, as in the Rape of the
Lock, the counter-part of their corporeal
qualities, and they are a race
of beings distinct from man, and not
deceased mortals, as with Pope, who
was indebted for this circumstance
to the account of the fairy train in
Dryden's Flower and Leaf:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

 Evidently from Addison's Spectator,
No. 69, May, 1711. "The
single dress of a woman of quality is
often the product of an hundred climates.
The muff and the fan come
together from the different ends of the
earth. The scarf is sent from the torrid
zone, and the tippet from beneath

 A comparison pressed too far loses
its beauty in departing from truth.
When Pope makes Belinda equal, in
the glory of her appearance, to the
sun,&mdash;"the rival of his beams" who
was "of this great world both eye
and soul," he falls into an insipid
hyperbole. When Chaucer, in his

 "Did you ever," says Dennis,
"hear before that the planets were
rolled by the <i>aerial</i> kind?" and Pope
writes on the margin "expressly
otherwise." He states that the
"ethereal" kind are described down
to ver. 80, and that the "aerial
kind" are the "less refined" beings
who dwell "beneath the moon."
Clearly the distinction had not occurred
to him when he wrote the
poem, for he calls both kinds
"aerial" at ver. 76.</p></div>

 The snuff-box of the beau, and
the fan of the woman of fashion, are
frequent subjects of ridicule in the
Spectator. The fan was employed
to execute so many little coquettish
man&oelig;uvres, that Addison ironically
proposed that ladies should be drilled
in the use of it, as soldiers were
trained to the exercise of arms.</p></div>

</span></p>
<p>
Owing to the change of fashion the
particulars in the text no longer serve
to mark the time of the day. From
Swift's Journal of a Modern Lady,
written in 1728, we learn that the
fashionable dinner-hour, when "the
long labours of the toilet ceased," was
four o'clock. Cards were reserved for
after tea; but the holiday-makers,
who in the Rape of the Lock, go by
water to Hampton Court, are represented
as playing from the usual dinner-hour
till coffee is brought in,
which may have been a common
arrangement in these pleasure-parties.</p></div>

 Ombre was invented in Spain,
and owed its name to the phrase
which was to be used by the person
who undertook to stand the game,&mdash;"<i>Yo
soy l'hombre</i>, I am the man."
In the Rape of the Lock Belinda was
the ombre, and hence she is described
as encountering singly her two antagonists.</p></div>

 The whole idea of this description
of a game at ombre is taken from
Vida's description of a game at Chess
in his poem intitled <i>Scacchia Ludus</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Pope not only borrowed the general
conception of representing the game
under the guise of a battle, but he
has imitated particular passages of
his Latin prototype. Vida's poem is
a triumph of ingenuity, when the
intricacy of chess is considered, and
the difficulty of expressing the moves
in a dead language. Yet the original
is eclipsed by Pope's more consummate
copy.</p></div>

 Spadillio is from <i>Espadilla</i>, the
Spanish term for the ace of spades;
and <i>Basto</i> is the Spanish name for
the ace of clubs. Whatever suit was
trumps the ace of spades was the first
card in power, and the ace of clubs
the third. Manillio, the second in
power of the three Matadores, varied
with the trumps. When spades or
clubs were trumps Manillio was the
two of trumps, and when hearts or
diamonds were trumps Manillio was
the seven of trumps.</p></div>

<p>
Nisus had a purple hair on which
depended the safety of himself and
his kingdom. When the Cretans
made war upon him, his daughter
Scylla fell in love with their leader
Minos, whom she saw from a high
tower. Hurried away by her passion,
she plucked out her father's hair as
he slept, and carried it to Minos, who
was victorious in consequence, and
Scylla was turned for her crime into
a bird. The line of Pope is made up
from a passage in Dryden's translation
of the first Georgic, where, having
applied the epithet "injured" to
Nisus, he adds,

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
And thus the purple hair is dearly paid.

 A famous book written about that

Mrs. Manley, the author of it, was
the daughter of Sir Roger Manley,
Governor of Guernsey, and the author
of the first volume of the famous Turkish
Spy, published from his papers,
by Dr. Midgley. She was known and
admired by all the wits of the times.
She died in the house of Alderman
Barber, Swift's friend; and was said
to have been the mistress of the alderman.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Her actions were even more infamous
than her writings. One Mary Thompson
had been kept by a person named
Pheasant, and at his death, in 1705,
she endeavoured to pass herself off for
his wife, that she might have a right
of dower out of his estate. According
to Mr. Nichols, in a note to
Steele's Letters, Mrs. Manley was
bribed by the promise of 100<i>l.</i> a-year
for life, to aid Mrs. Thompson in
getting a forged entry of the marriage
inserted in a register. The case was
heard in Doctors' Commons, and
Mrs. Manley's guilt was proved. But
neither her profligacy nor her frauds
could deprive her of the countenance
of political partisans like Swift and
Prior, or of good-natured men of
pleasure like Steele.</p></div>

The ancients believed the spleen to
be the seat of mirth, and hence a
disordered spleen was supposed to
produce melancholy and moroseness.
The second sense, in modern usage,
has driven out the first, and spleen
has become synonymous with surliness
and gloom, but Pope in prose
as well as verse gave it a wider range,
and appears to ascribe to it those
creations of the imagination which
are mistaken for realities. "Methinks,"
he writes to Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu, "I am imitating
in my ravings the <i>dreams of splenetic</i>
enthusiasts and solitaires, who fall
in love with saints and fancy themselves
in favour of angels and
spirits."</p></div>

by the expression "angels in machines"

Van Swieten, in his Commentaries

bringing wood to his fire threw it carelessly
down. Our sage was terrified
for his legs of glass. The girl, out of
patience with his megrims, gave him
a blow with a log on the parts affected.
He started up in a rage, and from

glass legs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

 In imitation of the golden branch

Spleenwort is a species of fern. "Its

itself with "painted flowers," and
exclaim,</p>

 Bishop Lowth notices Pope's frequent
violation of grammar in joining
a pronoun in the singular to a verb
in the plural. Thus when he says
in the Messiah,

</p><div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">O thou my voice inspire</span><br />
Who touched Isaiah's hallowed lips with fire,
</div></div></div><p>

either "thou" should be "you," or
else "touched" should be "touchedst,
didst touch." Pope has committed
the same error in this speech to the
Queen of Spleen; for that "thou,"
and not "you," is, or ought to be, the
pronoun understood follows from the
expression "<i>thy</i> power" at ver. 65.
Hence "who rule" should be "who
rulest," or "who dost rule," and so
with the other verbs in the second
person.</p></div>

"a cane very curiously clouded, and
a blue ribbon to hang it on his wrist,"
protests that the "knocking it upon
his shoe, leaning one leg upon it, or
whistling with it on his mouth are
such great reliefs to him in conversation
that he does not know how to
be good company without it." A
second beau is warned that his cane
must be forfeited if "he walks with
it under his arm, brandishes it in the
air, or hangs it on a button."</p></div>

From the catalogue which follows

below,&mdash;a career very short in instances
like the "tears of heirs," and,
perhaps, very long in instances like

 Wakefield says "there is an affectation and ambiguity in this account which

 "Pray in your next," writes Caryll to Pope, July 16, 1717, "tell me who
was the unfortunate lady you address a copy of verses to. I think you once gave
me her history, but it is now quite out of my head." Pope, in his reply
does not allude to the subject, and Caryll says to him on Aug. 18, "You answer
not my question who the unfortunate lady was that you inscribe a copy of verses
to in your book. I long to be re-told her story, for I believe you already told me
formerly; but I shall refer that, and a thousand other things more, to chat over
at our next meeting, which I hope draws near." This letter was answered by
Pope on Aug. 22, but there is still not a word on the unfortunate lady.</p></div>

 Dr. Morell, in his notes to Seneca's Epistles, says, "I remember when I was a
boy at Eton that an old almswoman, Mrs. Pain, having been cut down alive, gave
this reason for hanging herself, that she was afraid of dying." To rush into death
from the fear of death is not uncommon, and shows how far suicide is from being
an evidence of superior courage. Acute philosophers have not always reasoned
better than Pope. M. Lerminier, a French writer of repute, eulogises, in his
Philosophie du Droit, the suicide of Cato for "a pure and majestic act." "In the
Memoirs of the Emperor's Valet," he says in the next sentence, "we learn that
Napoleon tried to destroy himself at Fontainebleau in 1814. He took poison;
remedies were applied, and he recovered. He was not to die thus. Would you
wish that Napoleon's end should have been that of an amorous sub-lieutenant, or a
ruined banker?" But this was the veritable end of Cato. He died the death of
"amorous sub-lieutenants and ruined bankers." The question of M. Lerminier
revealed his consciousness that suicide was not heroism, or, in justification of the
attempt of the Emperor, he would have asked, "Would you not have wished that
Napoleon's end should have been the pure and majestic end of Cato?"</p></div>

 A belief akin to that which grew up in deserts prevailed in England. Hamlet
doubts whether his father's ghost is a "spirit of health or goblin damned," and
Horatio attempts to dissuade Hamlet from following it lest it should prove to be an
impostor. A "goblin damned" may have put on the "fair and warlike form"
of the King of Denmark, may "tempt" Hamlet to the "dreadful summit of the
cliff," may "there assume some other horrible form which might draw him into
madness," and impel him to commit suicide. The radical idea is the same in
Shakespeare and Marco Polo. Fiends personate the relations or friends of an intended
victim that they may decoy him to his death.</p></div>

 Johnson gives two meanings for
"to gore,"&mdash;"to stab," "to pierce;"
and "to pierce with a horn." The
second, or special signification, has
since superseded the general sense in
popular usage, though, as with many
other words, a sense which has become
obsolete in conversation is occasionally
revived in books. Formerly,
the general sense of "to pierce,"
without reference to the mode of
piercing, was the predominant meaning,
and Milton, Par. Lost, vi. 386,
employed the word to denote the gaps
made in the ranks of a defeated

 The anonymous translator of
Ariadne to Theseus:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Poor Ariadne! thou must perish here,<br />
Breathe out thy soul in strange and hated air,<br />
Nor see thy pitying mother shed one tear;<br />
Want a kind hand, which thy fixed eyes may close,<br />
And thy stiff limbs may decently compose.<br />
</div></div></div>

So Gay in his Dione, Act ii. Sc. 1:</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>
De Quincey assumes that the term
"decent limbs" refers to the lady's
shape, and he remarks that the
language "does not imply much enthusiasm
of praise." Pope had perhaps
the same idea in his mind as
the translator he imitated, and "thy
decent limbs were composed" may be
put inaccurately for "thy limbs were
composed decently."</p></div>

 The poet in the previous couplet
has employed the word "mourn" to
signify genuine regret. In this verse
it is put for the act of wearing mourning,&mdash;the
appearing in the "sable
weeds," which are, "the mockery of
woe" when the sorrow is not real.</p></div>

 Such a poem as Pope's Elegy,
deeply serious and pathetic, rejects
with disdain all fiction. Upon that
account the passage from ver. 59 to
ver. 68 deserves no quarter; for it is
not the language of the heart, but of
the imagination indulging its flights
at ease, and by that means is eminently
discordant with the subject.
It would be a still more severe censure
if it should be ascribed to imitation,
copying indiscreetly what has
been said by others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Kames.</span>
</p>
<p>
The ghost of the injured person
appears to excite the poet to revenge
her wrongs. He describes her character,
execrates the author of her misfortunes,
expatiates on the severity
of her fate, the rites of sepulture denied
her in a foreign land. Then
follows, "What though no weeping,"
&amp;c. Can anything be more
naturally pathetic? Yet the critic
tells us he can give no quarter to this
part of the poem. Well might our
poet's last wish be to commit his
writings to the candour of a sensible
and reflecting judge, rather than to
the malice of every short-sighted and
malevolent critic.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span></p></div>

 Dean Milman, in his History of Latin Christianity, says that Heloisa "was

 "She knew Latin," says M. Rémusat, "and wrote it with facility and
talent. As to Greek and Hebrew I can hardly believe that she was acquainted
with more than the alphabet, and a few words which were quoted habitually in
theology or in philosophy." The treatises of Abelard prove that he could read
neither Greek nor Hebrew, and it is not likely that Heloisa was more learned
than her master. Latin was the literary language of the day.</p></div>

 M. Rémusat, who accepts the letters without misgiving, acknowledges that
the form of the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i> "appears to be an artificial frame to the
picture." He assumes that the avowed purpose is a pretext, and that the
repentant philosopher commences his narrative with a misstatement. The fiction
which M. Rémusat is obliged to admit, does not ward off the strongest objection
to the genuineness of the letters, and is the hypothesis least favourable to the
reputation of Abelard; for his treachery to Heloisa is immensely aggravated by
the admission that his narrative was meant for the public, and not for the eye
alone of a friend.</p></div>

 Heloisa to Abelard: "I am here
a sinner, but one, who far from weeping
for her sins, weeps only for her
lover; far from abhorring her crimes
endeavours only to add to them, and
then who pleases herself continually with
the remembrance of past actions
when it is impossible to renew them."
And again: "I, who have experienced
so many pleasures in loving
you feel, in spite of myself, that I
cannot repent of them, nor forbear
enjoying them over again as much as
is possible by recollecting them in
my memory." Abelard, in the translation
of the letters, expresses the
same sentiment: "Love still preserves
its dominion in my fancy, and
entertains itself with past pleasures."</p></div>

 The idea of the "wings of seraphs
shedding perfumes" is from
Milton, Par. Lost, v. 286, where
Raphael "shakes heavenly fragrance"
from "his plumes," and Dryden in
his Tyrannic Love, Act v., mentions
the perfumes, the spousals, and the
celestial music as accompaniments of
the death of St. Catherine:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Æthereal music did her death prepare,<br />

And music dying in remoter sounds.<br />

 Heloisa to Abelard: "I will own
to you what makes the greatest pleasure
I have in my retirement. After
having passed the day in thinking of
you, full of the dear idea I give myself
up at night to sleep. Then it is
that Heloise, who dares not without
trembling think of you by day, resigns
herself entirely to the pleasure of
hearing you, and speaking to you. I
see you Abelard, and glut my eyes
with the sight. Sometimes forgetting
the perpetual obstacles to our desires,
you press me to make you happy,
and I easily yield to your transports.
Sleep gives me what your enemies'
rage has deprived you of, and our
souls, animated with the same passion,
are sensible of the same pleasure.
But, oh, you delightful illusions, soft
errors, how soon do you vanish away!
At my awaking I open my eyes, and
see no Abelard; I stretch out my
arms to take hold of him, but he is
not there; I call upon him, he hears
me not."</p></div>

 "It should," says Mr. Mills, "be
<i>near</i> her cell. The doors of all
cells open into the common cloister.
In that cloister are often tombs."
Steevens adds the frivolous objection
that the "Paraclete had been
too recently founded for monuments
of the dead to be expected there."
Heloisa had been five years abbess
when she wrote her first letter to
Abelard, and it is certainly not an
extravagant supposition that a death
might have occurred among the nuns
in that space of time.</p></div>

 Warton says that the eight concluding
lines of the Epistle "are
rather flat and languid." It is indeed
an absurd supposition that a
woman who had been speaking the
fervid language of christianity should
imagine that her state in the world
beyond the grave would be that of a
"pensive ghost," and that her consolation
would consist in having her
woes "well-sung" on earth. And it
is in the tremendous conflict between
piety and passion, while divine and
human love are contending fiercely
for the mastery, that she finds relief
in this unsubstantial idea that some
future lover would make her the subject
of a poem.</p></div>

 Roscoe supposes Richardson to have asserted that there was an "entire discrepancy
between the Essay on Man as published, and the original manuscripts,"
and to have implied that the change was from "infidelity" to its opposite. This
is not the statement of Richardson. He says, on the contrary, that when the
"exceptionable passages" were pointed out Pope "did not think of altering
them," and "never dreamed of adopting" a more orthodox "scheme" for his
Essay till after "its fatalism and deistical tendency" had excited that "general
alarm" which could not precede the publication of the poem, and which only, in
fact, commenced some three years later. Richardson is enforcing his charge
against Warburton of inventing forced meanings, and the instance would contradict
the accusation if Pope had altered his language from deism to orthodoxy
before he printed the work. The commentary would then have expressed the
natural sense of the text. The change of which Richardson speaks was not in the
Essay itself, but in the interpretation Pope put upon it. While he was composing
the poem he accepted the deistical construction of the Richardsons; and
when he was terrified at the "general alarm" he endorsed the christian construction
of Warburton.</p></div>

 Dr. Desaguliers, the son of a French refugee, was born at Rochelle in 1683,
and died, Feb. 29, 1744, at the Bedford Coffee-house, Covent Garden. He was
a clergyman of the church of England, a great lover of science, and a friend of
Newton. He delivered lectures for many years on Experimental Philosophy, and
published an excellent work on the subject in 2 vols. 4to. He does not appear
to have shown any turn for poetry, and those who ascribed to him the Essay on
Man may have had no better ground for their opinion than that the poem treated
of one kind of philosophy, and Desaguliers was learned in another.</p></div>

 Thomas Catesby, Lord Paget, son of the Earl of Uxbridge, died before his
father in Jan. 1742. He published in 1734, a poem called An Essay on Human
Life; and in 1737 An Epistle to Mr. Pope, in Anti-heroics. "The former,"
says Horace Walpole, "is written in imitation of Pope's ethic epistles, and has
good lines, but not much poetry."</p></div>

 In the Life of Pope by the pretended Squire Ayre, it is said that "a certain
gentleman," meaning Mallet, was at Pope's house shortly after the first Epistle
was published, and in answer to the question "What new pieces were brought to
light?" replied, "That there was a thing come out called an Essay on Man, and
it was a most abominable piece of stuff; shocking poetry, insufferable philosophy,
no coherence, no connection at all." Pope confessed he was the author, which,
says Ayre, "was like a clap of thunder to the mistaken bard; with a blush and
a bow he took his leave of Pope, and never ventured to show his unlucky face
there again." The final statement is contradicted by the letters of Pope and
Mallet, which prove that they carried on a cordial intercourse to the last. The
rest of the story is improbable, for it is not likely that Pope, who was bent at
this early period upon keeping the authorship a secret, would have unmasked
himself in a manner to preclude confidence, and provoke Mallet to divulge the
truth to the world. Ayre's authority is good for nothing, and Ruffhead only
copied Ayre, but his repetition of the anecdote gave it currency, and it has ever
since passed unquestioned from writer to writer.</p></div>

 Warburton. "Your Travels I hear much of," says Pope in the letter to
Swift; "my own I promise you shall never more be in a strange land, but a
diligent, I hope, useful investigation of my own territories. I mean no more
translations, but something domestic, fit for my own country, and my own time."
The allusion is obscure, and it may be doubted whether Pope referred to his ethical
scheme, which he did not commence till four years later.</p></div>

 The authority was Lord Bathurst. Dr. Hugh Blair dined with him in 1763,
and says in a letter to Boswell, that "the conversation turning on Mr. Pope,
Lord Bathurst told us that the Essay on Man was originally composed by Lord
Bolingbroke in prose, and that Mr. Pope did no more than put it into verse:
that he had read Lord Bolingbroke's manuscript in his own handwriting, and
remembered well that he was at a loss whether most to admire the elegance of
Lord Bolingbroke's prose, or the beauty of Mr. Pope's verse." Boswell read the
account to Johnson, who replied, "Depend upon it, sir, this is too strongly stated.
Pope may have had from Bolingbroke the philosophic stamina of his Essay, and
admitting this to be true, Lord Bathurst did not intentionally falsify. But the
thing is not true in the latitude that Blair seems to imagine; we are sure that
the poetical imagery, which makes a great part of the poem, was Pope's own."</p></div>

 Warton states that Dobson relinquished the undertaking from the impossibility
of preserving in Latin verse the conciseness of the English. He appears
to have accomplished half his task; for when Christopher Smart subsequently
volunteered his services, Pope said in his reply, Nov. 18, 1740, "The two first
epistles are already well done." A specimen from Dobson's translation of each
of these epistles was among the papers of Spence, and is printed in the appendix
to Mr. Singer's edition of the Anecdotes. A version of the Essay in Latin hexameters
appeared at Wirtemberg. This, Pope tells Smart, was "very faithful but
inelegant," and he adds that his reason for desiring a more adequate rendering
was that either the sense or the poetry was lost in all the foreign translations.</p></div>

 This sort of burlesque abstract, which may be so easily but so unjustly made
of any composition whatever, is exactly similar to the imperfect and unfair representation
which the same critic has given of the beautiful imagery in Il Penseroso
of Milton.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Johnson's criticism of a poem like this, cannot be compared with his futile
declamation against the imagery of the Penseroso. For in speaking of the Penseroso,
Johnson spoke of what I do not hesitate to say he did not understand. He
had no congenial feelings properly to appreciate the character of such poetry; but
the case is different where he brings his great mind to try, by the test of truth,
arguments and doctrines which appeal to the understanding. Johnson was not
an inadequate judge of Pope's philosophy, though he was certainly so of Milton's
poetry. But no composition could possibly stand before his contemptuous
declamation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

 Bowles himself had a low opinion of the "system of philosophy" embodied
in the Essay on Man. After stating that Pope was the pupil of Bolingbroke, he
adds, "But this poem will continue to charm from the music of its verse, the
splendour of its diction, and the beauty of its illustrations, when the philosophy
that gave rise to it, like the coarse manure that fed the flowers, is perceived and
remembered no more."</p></div>

 "It may safely," says Lord Kames, "be pronounced a capital defect in the
composition of a verse, to put a low word, incapable of an accent, in the place
where this accent should be," and he instances the last syllable of "dependencies,"
in Pope's Essay on Man, Epist. i. ver. 30:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
But of this frame, the bearings and the ties,<br />
The strong connections, nice dependencies,<br />
Gradations just, &amp;c.
</div></div></div>
<p>

What appeared a defect to Lord Kames will seem to many persons an advantage.
The want of accent softens the rhyme, and relieves the monotonous, cloying effect
of a full concord of sound. In most of Pope's imperfect rhymes the similarity of
sound is too slight, and the ear is disappointed.</p></div>

 Spence, who wrote down the anecdote from Warburton's conversation, says
that Hooke talked of "Lord Bolingbroke's disbelief of the moral attributes of
God," which agrees substantially with the language in Ruffhead.</p></div>

 &OElig;uvres de Louis Racine, ed. 1808, tom. i. p. 444. "If," said Voltaire,
"Pope wrote this letter to Racine, God must have given him at the close of his
life the gift of tongues." Voltaire repeats three times over in his works, that he
associated with Pope for a twelvemonth, and knew, what was publicly notorious
in England, that he could hardly read French, and could not speak one word or
write one line of the language. The objection was founded on the mistaken
assumption that the French translation was the original letter. In the later
editions of Racine's poem the letter is printed from Pope's English. Voltaire was
annoyed that Pope should "retract" his deism, and wanted to have it believed
that Ramsay alone was responsible for the sentiments expressed in the letter to
Racine.</p></div>

 A man may eat from principle, which often happens with the sick when they
are wishing to die, and appetite is extinct. For the same reason they may eat

the choice food without tasting it.</p></div>

 The second Epistle of the Essay
on Man had the brief preface which
follows: "The author has been induced
to publish these Epistles separately
for two reasons, the one that
he might not impose upon the public
too much at once of what he thinks
incorrect; the other, that by this
method he might profit of its judgment
on the parts, in order to make
the whole less unworthy of it."</p></div>

 For "St. John" the manuscript
has "Memmius," and the first edition
"Lælius." Memmius was an author
and orator of no great distinction to
whom Lucretius dedicated his De
Rerum Natura. Lælius was celebrated
for his statesmanship, his
philosophical pursuits, and his friendship,
and is described by Horace as
delighting, on his retirement from
public affairs, in the society of the
poet Lucilius. Thus the name was
fitted to the functions of Bolingbroke,
and the relation in which he stood to
Pope.</p></div>

In a letter to Swift, Dec. 19, 1734,
Pope says that the couplet was a
monitory, and ineffectual hint to
Bolingbroke, to give up politics for
philosophy. If the censure was directed
against the party vices of the
man the reproof is inconsistent with
the eulogy on his patriotism, Epist.
iv. ver. 265, and if against his pursuit
in the abstract, it is folly to say
that statesmanship is one of the
"meaner things" which should be
left to "low ambition," and empty
"pride."</p></div>

 This exordium relates to the
whole work, first in general, then in
particular. The 6th, 7th, and 8th
lines allude to the subjects of this
book,&mdash;the general order and design
of Providence; the constitution of
the human mind, whose passions cultivated
are virtues, neglected vices;
the temptations of misapplied self-love,
and wrong pursuits of power,
pleasure, and false happiness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p>
<p>
"The whole work" was to have
been in four books, and the phrase
"this book" means the four published

 The last part of the verse is barbarously
elliptical. The meaning is
that all our reasonings respecting the
end of man must be drawn from his
station here, and to this station we
must refer all that we learn respecting
him. Since we can know nothing
but what relates to our present condition,
the doctrine of a future life is
excluded.</p></div>

Pope's assertion in the text that it
is impossible for us to "tell why
heaven has made us as we are," unless
we had a complete insight into
the plan of universal creation, contradicts
ver. 48, where he says that
"it is plain there must be somewhere

 "Why one reason," says Wakefield,
"should be harder than the
other I am unable to discern." The
passage is taken, as Warton pointed
out, from Voltaire's remarks on
Pascal's Thoughts, but Voltaire put
the questions on the same footing,
and did not pretend that the second
was harder to solve than the first.
"You are astonished," he says "that
God has made man so contracted, so
ignorant, and so unhappy. Why are
you not astonished that he has not
made him more contracted, more
ignorant, and more unhappy?"
Neither question ought to have presented
any difficulty to Pope, since
it was "plain" to him that "the
best possible system" required that
"there should be somewhere such a
rank as man." All who admit the
attributes of the Deity must allow
that every portion of the world, sentient
or insensible, is the consummation
of wisdom with reference to its
place in the infinite and eternal
scheme. "God," says Leibnitz, "does
not even neglect inanimate things;
they are unconscious, but God is conscious
for them. He would reproach
himself with the least real defect in
the universe, although no one perceived
it."</p></div>

 This word is commonly pronounced
in prose with the e mute in

Jupiter. Any mathematician could

not revolve round him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Voltaire.</span>
</p>
<p>
Warburton, to evade Voltaire's criticism,
put a strained and paraphrastic
interpretation upon Pope's
lines. Their natural meaning is, that
man is too ignorant to comprehend
why he is not less instead of greater,&mdash;nay,
that he cannot even tell why oaks
are taller than weeds, why Jupiter's
satellites are less than Jupiter, and
all his investigations into the earth
and the heavens will not supply him
with the answer.</p></div>

 Pope did not generally condescend
to the artificial inversion which places

Here, in a passage where simplicity

 Bolingbroke, Fragment 43: "It
might be determined in the divine
ideas that there should be a gradation
of life and intellect throughout the
universe. In this case it was necessary
that there should be some creatures
at our pitch of rationality."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span>
</p>
<p>
The theory of a chain of beings
was adopted by Bolingbroke and
Pope from Archbishop King's Essay
on the Origin of Evil. Arguing from
the analogy of our own world, King
contended that a universe fully
peopled with superior natures would
leave room for an inferior grade, and
these for lower grades still, in a continuously
descending scale. There
must either be inferior creatures, or
else voids in creation, and we may presume
that the maximum of existence
is most conducive to the ends of
benevolence and wisdom.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
The sentence quoted by Wakefield
was copied by Bolingbroke from Leibnitz.
Lord Shaftesbury adopted the
same hypothesis in his Inquiry concerning
Virtue. If, he says, our earth
is a part only of some other system,
and if what is ill in our system makes
for the good of the general system,
then there is nothing ill with respect
to the whole. Rousseau, who heartily
embraced the doctrine, remarks that
"we cannot give direct proofs for or
against, because these proofs depend
on a complete knowledge of the constitution
of the universe, and of the
ends of its author."</p></div>

 Bolingbroke, Fragments 43 and
63: "We labour hard, we complicate
various means to bring about some
one paltry purpose.&mdash;In the works of
men the most complicated schemes
produce very hardly and very uncertainly
one single effect: in the works
of God one single scheme produces a
multitude of different effects, and
answers an immense variety of purposes."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span>
</p>
<p>
How clearly and closely is this sentiment
expressed by Pope, and yet
how difficult to render into verse with
precision and effect.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span>
</p>
<p>
In the first line the phrase "one
single," for "one single movement,"
is especially inelegant. Bowles might
have selected many couplets from the
Essay on Man more deserving of the
commendation. The thought which
Pope owed to Bolingbroke, Bolingbroke
owed to Leibnitz, who says in
his Théodicée, "Everything in nature
is connected, and if a skilful artizan,
engineer, architect, statesman, often
makes the same contrivance serve for
several purposes, we may affirm that
God, whose wisdom and power are
perfect, does so always." Hence Pope
contends that what is defective in
man considered separately, may be
advantageous in relation to the hidden
ends he is intended to serve.</p></div>

to constitute it properly one administration

have a thorough knowledge of any

This note appeared, 1735, in vol.
2 of the quarto edition of Pope's
Poetical Works. The lines originally
followed ver. 98, and when they
re-appeared in the text in 1743
they were shifted to their present
position. They are especially
bad,&mdash;elliptical and prosaic in expression,
and sophistical in argument.
The suffering which matters
nothing when it is over is not unimportant
while it lasts. A prolonged
imprisonment in a noisome dungeon
does not cease to be a penalty because
the captive will one day be free. The
Bible recognises the bitterness of
human misery, but teaches that
christians are to be reconciled to it
on account of the moral purposes it
subserves, and the endless felicity
which ensues. Pope notes in his MS.
that ver. 76 is "reversed from Lucretius
on death," and Wakefield quotes
the translation of Dryden which Pope
copied:</p>

<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

</p>
<p>
Pope, in the MS., had expanded

<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
No great, no little; 'tis as much decreed<br />
That Virgil's Gnat should die as Cæsar bleed.
</div></div></div><p>

It is doubtful whether Virgil was the
author of the Culex or Gnat, which,
says Mr. Long, "is a kind of Bucolic
poem in 413 hexameters, often very
obscure." Pope's assertion that there
is "no great, no little," is contradicted
by the passage in St. Matthew
to which Warburton refers. Our
Lord there assures us that "we are of
more value than many sparrows," and
the ruin of a world, with its myriad
of sentient beings, must be of infinitely
greater moment in the sight of
the Deity than the bursting of a
bubble. Pope repeats, ver. 279, a
statement which is repugnant to
reason, to revelation, and to his own
system of a scale of beings.</p></div>

 Pope has frequently contradicted
this line, and allowed that men who
place their happiness in right objects,
and use the recognised means, enjoy
a present pleasure, in addition to the
hope of an equal or greater pleasure
in the future. This hope in turn is
constantly realised, in contradiction
to the lively saying ascribed to Lord
Bacon, that "hope makes a good
breakfast, but a bad supper."</p></div>

 Bolingbroke, Fragment 25: "This

the dissatisfaction of certain civilised

The contentment and dissatisfaction
are applied by Pope to different
objects, the contentment of the
savage being limited to his idea of a
future life, whereas the dissatisfaction
of civilised man is said to be
chiefly with his present condition,
about which the savage is often dissatisfied
likewise. The imperfect information
of missionaries is not even
sufficient warrant for asserting that
all Indians believed in a future state,
and if there were dissentients among
them their case did not differ from that
of civilised men. Above all the contentment
of the Indian is the result
of grovelling views, and uninquiring
ignorance, and whatever may be the
errors of infidels among ourselves they
cannot be remedied by an appeal to
those blind conceptions of the savage,
which Pope supposed to be false.
"Our flattering ourselves here," he
said to Spence, "with the thoughts
of enjoying the company of our friends
when in the other world may be but
too like the Indians thinking that
they shall have their dogs and horses
there."</p></div>

 "Gust," or the relish for anything,

 The meaning cannot be that the
caviller complained that other creatures
were made perfect as well as
himself, because nobody supposed
that either men or animals were perfect.
Pope apparently means that
these persons complained that man
was not an exception to the general
law of imperfection and mortality,
although he "alone" would then
have been "perfect" in this world,
and immortal in the next. It follows
that the objectors disbelieved in the
immortality of the soul, and that
Pope thought their demand for immortality
unreasonable.</p></div>

 Divines maintained that there
must be a future state, or that many
of the phenomena of this life would be
inexplicable. Bolingbroke rejected
a future state, and argued that this
life was a scheme complete in itself.
All who did not concur in his view
"joined," he said, "in a clamour
against Providence," and "murmured
against his justice." Not that
they had ever uttered a syllable
against Providence, for they were
devout and humble adorers of his
perfections, but they denied that
Bolingbroke's scheme was God's
scheme, and Bolingbroke in his
arrogance and passion insisted that
whoever repudiated his philosophy
set himself up against God. Pope
versified the declamation of Bolingbroke,
without pointing it to the
class against whom it was originally
directed.</p></div>

 Piety must equally answer with
grateful adoration that all these things
have been created for the use of man.
The error of pride is in the assumption
that they have been created for
man alone, who is only one out of
an infinity of creatures on our globe,
as our globe again is only a portion
of a larger system. Hence Pope
intends us to infer, that it is folly
for us to test all things by the consequences
to ourselves. The language,
however, which he puts into
the mouth of pride is extravagant, and
"can hardly," says M. Crousaz,
"have been ever uttered by any one,
unless it were in jest."</p></div>

 "A nation" in the first edition.
The expression is hyperbolical. Pope
alludes to such catastrophes as the
inundation of Jutland when the sea
broke down the dykes in 1634, and
fifteen thousand people were drowned.
Irruptions on a smaller scale have
sometimes been occasioned by the
rising of the sea during an earthquake.
In that of 1783 the inhabitants of
Scilla, in the kingdom of Naples,
deserted their city to avoid being
crushed by the falling houses, and
fled to the shore. A mighty wave,
which swept three miles inland,
carried back with it 2473 persons, and
their prince among the number. Cowper,
The Task, ii. 117, has recorded
the tragedy in his grandest verse:

</p><div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

 Pope says, that "earthquakes
swallow towns <i>to</i> one grave, whole

should be "in." But this would not
have suited the phrase "tempests

The government by general laws, we
are told, has "a few exceptions,"
which must either refer to the
scripture miracles, which Pope did
not believe when he wrote the Essay
on Man, or to the doctrine of a
special providence, which he opposes

 "Some change" for "there has
been some change," is bad English.
The argument is not superior to the
language. Plagues, earthquakes, and
tempests, say the vindicators of
nature, may in part be explained by
the changes which have taken place
since the creation of the world. Pope,
Epist. iv. ver. 115, repeats that
"evil" has been "admitted"
through "change." As no reason is
assigned for this conversion of physical
good into physical evil, the
supposition does not diminish the
difficulty.</p></div>

 On a cursory reading we might
understand Pope to mean that nature
sometimes deviates from her stated
course for the purpose of promoting
human happiness. This sense does
not agree with the context, and the
true interpretation is, that if the
great end of terrestrial creation is
allowed to be human happiness, then
it is clear that nature sometimes
deviates from that end, as in the
instance of plagues and earthquakes.</p></div>

 The assertion is monstrous that
we cannot be expected to control our
evil passions because nature has her
storms, diseases, and earthquakes.
This is not to justify the ways of
God, but the ways of wicked men.
The physical evil ordained by the
ruler of the world, cannot be put
upon the same foundation with the
moral evil which reason and revelation
condemn. Sin is permitted because
it is better that offences should
exist than that free will should be
destroyed, but it is lamentable that
we should will to do evil in preference
to good. The justification of the
abuses of free will is a distinct proposition
from the argument into
which Pope glides, that it is not
harder to understand why man should
be allowed to be a scourge to man
than why suffering should be inflicted
through the agency of earthquakes
and pestilence.</p></div>

 Shortly after his father, Alexander

in 1492, Cæsar Borgia commenced
the career of war, massacre, and
murder which made him the scourge

by a musket-ball at a petty siege in
1507. The conspiracy of Catiline
against the Roman government was
terminated by his death at the head
of his banditti, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 62, but from his
depraved and desperate character
there was every reason to believe that
he would have used a victory to

</p>
<p>
Pope is answering the objections to
moral evil. The passions for which
he has undertaken to account are
vicious in kind or in degree&mdash;they
are the passions which are contrary
to "virtue," ver. 166,&mdash;the passions
of Borgia, Catiline, Cæsar, and Alexander,&mdash;and
these are not elements

 Pope uses almost the very words
of Bolingbroke: "To think worthily
of God we must think that the
natural order of things has been
always the same; and that a being
of infinite wisdom and knowledge, to
whom the past and the future are
like the present, and who wants no
experience to inform him, can have
no reason to alter what infinite wisdom
and knowledge have once done."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
In saying that the "general order"
had been "kept," Pope did not mean
that there were no exceptions, for he
held that there had been "some
change" since the beginning of things,
which was to reject the fanciful principle
of Bolingbroke. Infinite wisdom
cannot err, but change is not
necessarily the reparation of error,
and a progressive may be preferable
to a stationary system.</p></div>

 This is Pope's summary of his
weak defence of moral evil. Moral
and physical irregularities, he says in

both are indispensable. He denies
this in his third epistle, and asserts
that universal innocence endured for
several generations to the great advantage
of man.</p></div>

with drawing the picture of a

in general. But such fools are rarely

<p>
Bishop Butler, like Crousaz, did
not believe that such "fools" existed.
"Who," he asked, "ever felt uneasiness
upon observing any of the
advantages brute creatures have over
us?" Pope's authority was The Moralists
of Lord Shaftesbury. "Why,
says one, was I not made by nature
strong as a horse? Why not hardy
and robust as this brute creature? or
nimble and active as that other?"</p></div>

<p>
It was an ancient fancy that the
planets rolled along spheres, emitting
music as they went. Pope's
supposition that the music would
stun us, alludes to the remarks of
Cicero, Somnium Scipionis, that the
crash of harmony is so tremendous
that human ears cannot receive it,
just as human eyes cannot gaze at the
sun. Warburton remarks that Pope
should not have illustrated a philosophical
argument by the example of
an unreal sound.</p></div>

A very little observation would have
satisfied Pope that "green" is not
the prevailing hue of the "myriads
in the peopled grass." Wakefield
says that the expression "man's
imperial race," in ver. 209, is from
Dryden's Virg. Geo. iii. 377, and
that the general argument is from
Bolingbroke's Fragments: "There is
a gradation of sense and intelligence
here from animal beings imperceptible
to us for their minuteness, without
the help of microscopes, and even with
them, up to man." This is what
Leibnitz called "the law of continuity."
"Nature," he said, "never
proceeds by leaps."</p></div>

 The manner of the lions hunting
their prey in the deserts of Africa is
this; at their first going out in the
night-time they set up a loud roar,
and then listen to the noise made by
the beasts in their flight, pursuing
them by the ear, and not by the
nostril. It is probable, the story of
the jackal's hunting for the lion was
occasioned by observation of this defect
of scent in that terrible animal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p>
<p>
Pope was mistaken in his notion
that the lion hunted by ear alone, and
that his sense of smell was obtuse.
His scenting powers are very acute.
The account which Pope gives would
not, if it were true, explain why the
jackal should have been singled out
for the office of lion's provider. The
real reason is told by Livingstone.
When the lion is devouring his prey,
"the jackal comes sniffing about,
and sometimes suffers for his temerity
by a stroke from the lion's paw laying
him dead." The persevering
attempt of the lesser animal to share
the spoils with the greater, led to the
belief that the two worked in concert&mdash;that
the jackal was the pioneer,
and the lion the executioner. There
are two other readings of ver. 213 in
the MS.:

These lines are admirable patterns

epithets ought to be particularly regarded.
Perhaps we have no image

of ver. 218. "To live along the

In this part of the epistle the poet
seems to have remarkably laboured
his style, which abounds in various
figures, and is much elevated. Pope
has practised the great secret of
Virgil's art, which was to discover
the very single epithet that precisely
suited each occasion. If Pope must
yield to other poets in point of fertility
of fancy, or harmony of numbers,
yet in point of propriety, closeness,
and elegance of diction, he can yield
to none.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

Pope is illustrating his proposition
that there must be grades of capacity
for animal to be subject to animal,
and all animals to man. The application
of the couplet to his argument
is obscure, and the couplet itself very
vague. The "remembrance" closely
"allied to reflection" appears to be
the effort of attention by which we
recall the dormant stores of memory.
"Thought" is a dubious term, but
seems to be put by Pope for the acts
of mind which take their rise in the
mind itself, as willing, imagining,
reasoning, etc., in contradistinction
to seeing, feeling, taste, etc., which
are produced by the operation of
external things upon the senses.</p></div>

 A two-fold or mixed nature was
sometimes in old language called
a "middle nature," such as a compound
of mind and matter, or an
amphibious animal, and Pope perhaps
meant that the double nature "longs
to join" in a more intimate union.
Or he may have meant by "middle,"
an intermediate nature, such as any
creature which has an order of beings
above and below it, but then to satisfy
Pope's phraseology there must be
two of these middle natures which are
longing to unite with each other, and
the higher would not desire to be
"joined" to the lower. The couplet
seems at best to be mere mystical
jargon.</p></div>

conclusion the poet has touched the
idea with propriety, as well as dignity
and sublimity. If he had been more
particular, the passage would have
been unworthy the grandeur of the
subject; had he been less it would
have been obscure. He has at once
evinced judgment and poetry. If
there be a word or two not quite
suitable, perhaps it is "run," and
"foundations nod." I could have
wished such a word as "rushed lawless,"
or "flamed lawless through the

 The chief problem which Pope
undertook to solve was the existence
of moral evil. Yet, if man, in obedience
to God's commands, became
morally perfect, none of the disastrous
effects the poet describes would ensue.
Angels would not be hurled from
their spheres; worlds would not be
wrecked; nor would heaven's foundations
nod to their centre. Reason
and revelation unite in the conclusion
that moral perfection would, on the
contrary, be an unmitigated blessing.
Consequently Pope's hypothesis explains
nothing unless he had shown
how it is that a system which rendered
evil impossible would be inferior
to our own.</p></div>

 "Soul," says Samuel Clarke,
"signifies a part of a whole, whereof
body is the other part, and they,
being united, mutually affect each
other as parts of the same whole.
But God is present to every part of
the universe, not as a soul, but as a
governor, so as to act upon everything
in what manner he pleases,
himself being acted upon by nothing."
Warburton quotes some passages from
Sir Isaac Newton asserting the omnipresence
of the Deity, and the
commentator affirms that the poet
expressed the identical doctrine of the
philosopher. This is a misrepresentation.
The extracts of Warbuton are
from the scholium to the Principia,
where Newton adds, "God governs
all things, not as a soul of the world,
but as the Lord of the universe. The
Godhead of God is his dominion, a
dominion not like that of a soul over
its own body, but that of a Lord over
his servants." The doctrine which
Pope held in common with Sir Isaac
Newton was the omnipresence of the
Deity. The doctrine which Sir Isaac
Newton repudiated, and which Pope
maintained, was that the world was
the body of God as the human frame
is of man. The world in this sense
was not the work of the Deity, but
a portion of him. Pope abandoned
his present creed, Epist. iii. ver. 229,
where he says,

 Every ear must feel the ill effect
of the monotony in these lines. The
cause is obvious. When the pause
falls on the fourth syllable, we shall
find that we pronounce the six last in
the same time that we do the four
first, so that the couplet is not only
divided into two equal lines, but each

If there is to Providence "no high,

gradation of beings is a delusion.
What things are in the sight of God,
that they are in reality, and since no
one thing in creation is superior or
inferior to any other thing, Pope's
language throughout this epistle is
unmeaning. The final phrase of the
couplet is bathos. God is not only
the "equal" of "all" his works, he

 Johnson, in his translation of
Crousaz, says he cannot determine
whether any one has discovered the
true meaning of the words "in doubt
to act or rest." The language is
vague, and incapable of an interpretation
which is generally true;
but the probable sense seems to be
that man is in doubt whether to embrace
an active belief, or whether to
resign himself to a passive, inert
scepticism.</p></div>

 Warburton says that the phrase
"correct old Time" refers to Sir Isaac
Newton's Chronology of Antient Kingdoms
Amended, in which one of the
main positions was based upon astronomical
science. More probably Pope
alluded to the familiar fact of the
Gregorian reformation of the calendar
by substituting new style for old.
The change was adopted towards the
close of the sixteenth century through
the greater part of Europe, but the
old style was retained in England till
1752. By "regulate the sun," Wakefield
understands the use of equal
mean for unequal apparent time.</p></div>

"Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to
rule," exclaims Pope, ver. 29, and
Warburton correctly remarks that the
sarcastic summary is "a conclusion
from all that had been said before
from ver. 18 to this effect." The
illustrations which go before should
consequently be examples of the wild
attempts to show how the world
might have been better contrived,
and Pope points to such schemes
when he says, "<i>Instruct</i> the planets
in what orbs to run." But he has
perplexed his meaning by improperly
mixing up with instances of ignorant
presumption, those real discoveries in
science, which are the result of a
patient investigation of God's works,
and have no connection with the pretence
of "teaching Eternal Wisdom
how to rule."</p></div>

 Bolingbroke, Fragment 58: "They
soar up on Platonic wings to the first
good and the first just." Plato taught
that there was a good in itself, a just
in itself, a beautiful in itself, etc.
These ideas, as he called them, these
faultless archetypes of earthly qualities,
were not mere abstractions of
the mind. They had a real existence,
and all that was good, beautiful,
and just in this world, was derived
from them. The "empyreal
sphere" was the outermost of the
nine fictitious spheres of the ancients,
and is "inhabited," says Cicero in
his Vision of Scipio, "by that all-powerful
God who controls the other
spheres." Pope learned his contempt
of Plato from Bolingbroke, who said
of him with his usual intemperance,
and more than his usual ignorance,
that he was the "father of philosophical
lying, and treated every subject
like a bombast poet, and a mad
theologian."</p></div>

if we would know and imitate God
we must withdraw the mind from
the things of sense, and contemplate
the spiritual and the perfect.
Pope's object was to ridicule
those who thought that the perfections
of the Deity were to be the
model for the imperfect efforts of
man. The notion, he says, is not
less preposterous than the Eastern
absurdity of twisting in a circle to

The author of a Letter to Mr. Pope,

dissents. Either the angels could not

not have "shown him as we show an
ape," when he would have appeared a
grotesque and ludicrous object. The

 Sir Isaac Newton showed the probability,
converted into certainty by
later observations, that comets travelled
in elongated curves, and were
subjected to the identical law of
attraction which governed the motions
of the planets. The laws of
gravitation were the "rules" which
"bound" the comets, and Pope contrasts
these definite laws of matter
with the variable "movements" of
the human mind, which cannot be
"fixed" or reduced to rule. The
mind, however, has also its laws,
which, notwithstanding the disturbing
force of free-will, are sufficiently
understood for the practical purposes
of life.</p></div>

 The comparison is pointless.
Newton knew far more of his end,&mdash;of
his mission and ultimate destiny,&mdash;than
of the purpose and fate of
comets, and did not know less of his
own beginning than of the origin of the
heavenly bodies. Man is incapable of
conceiving the mode by which a single
atom of the universe was called into
being, nor can he penetrate to the
essence of a single law or particle of
matter any better than to the essence
of mind. After ver. 38 there is this
couplet in the MS.:</p>

 "Alas," says Pope, "what wonder"
that Newton should be unable
to "explain his own beginning and
end," since "what reason weaves is
undone by passion." But this cannot
be the cause of our inability to unfold
the creative process, for when passion
is not permitted to interfere with
reason we make no advance towards
an explanation of our "own beginning."
Passion does often interfere
with the just perception of our proper
"end," and with the practice of the
duties we perceive, only Pope should
have known that to rise superior to
passion is the daily discipline of hosts
of men. "It seems," says Pascal,
"to be the divine intention to perfect
the will rather than the understanding,"
and of the two we can
approximate nearer to moral perfection
than to universal science.</p></div>

 This paragraph first appeared in
the edition of 1743. In the preceding
paragraph, we are told that, in
physical science, man "may rise unchecked
from art to art." Unless,
therefore, Pope reckoned physical
science among the worthless departments
of knowledge, there was, by
his own statement, one vast and
important scientific region which was
destined to unlimited extension, and
of which it was not correct to say
that a "little sum" must serve the
future, as it had served the past.</p></div>

 Without self-love, that is, man
would be like "a plant," and without

slave of destructive passions. The
first comparison is inconsiderate.
The man who had no self-love,
which means no moving principle,
no affections or desires, would not
even "draw nutrition, and propagate."
The appetite for food, the
sexual appetite, and the care for life,
would all be wanting, and he would
"rot" at once. Or if reason, without
desires, could induce him to
foster an existence to which he
was totally indifferent, reason might
equally impel him to other acts besides
the preservation of himself, and
the perpetuation of his race.</p></div>

practice, and what beneficial. Pope's

 MS.: "nature." "Grace" here
signifies the Divine assistance vouchsafed
to the natural powers of man in
his efforts after goodness. Pope's original
reading,&mdash;"grace and nature"&mdash;was
a censure of the attempts to define
the respective influences exerted
by the nature of man, and the grace or
intervention of God. The substitute
of "virtue" for "nature," obscures
the meaning, but the poet apparently
had still in his mind the long controversies
on the share which appertained
to "grace" in the production
of "virtue." He may have thought
that it was needless to try and settle
the precise part which belonged to
grace, since nature and grace are both
gifts of the same Almighty Being.</p></div>

 Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato
divided the faculties into "sense and
reason," and the classification passed
from the ancients to the schoolmen.
"Sense" comprised the five senses,
with every act of the mind which was
supposed to depend on bodily sensations.
Under this head were included
the passions and desires, and
"sense," in its moral signification,
was the equivalent of what Pope calls
"self-love."</p></div>

Pope charges the schoolmen with
being at war about a name when
they distinguished between "sense"
and "reason," and the distinction
is a capital article in his own moral
creed. He charges them with maintaining
that sense and reason were
not merely separate, but contending
powers, and he too has insisted on
the universality of the strife. "Sense,"
or, in his language, "self-love,"
"looks," ver. 73, to "immediate,"
"reason" to "future good," and in
this difference of view the "temptations"
of self-love "throng thicker
than the arguments" of reason. The
contest is the subject of a long disquisition
further on, and Pope laments,
ver. 149-160, that passion should
conquer in the fight. When he
interjected the paragraph, in which
he contradicted himself, he rested his
case on the proposition that reason,
which pursues interest well-understood,
and self-love, which gratifies
present passion, "aspire to one
end,&mdash;pleasure." But the pleasure
sought by reason and self-love
respectively is not the same pleasure,
and so incompatible were the two
pleasures in his estimation that he
calls one, ver. 92, "our greatest
evil," the other "our greatest good."</p></div>

 The "imparted" or sympathetic
passions are the benevolent impulses
and affections. As to their "kind,"
or nature, they are, says Pope,
"modes of self-love," but when the
self-love assumes the form of loving
others the passion is "exalted, and
takes the name of some virtue." He
passes the affections over here with
this slight allusion, and returns to
them at ver. 255, and more at length
in Epistle iii.</p></div>

 The stoic aimed at inner perfection,
and trusted to the serenity
of virtue to sustain him in all the
trials of life. Pope erroneously imagined
that stoics were selfish and inactive
because they were calm and
self-contained. Seneca, De Ot. i. 4,
says, they insisted that we must never
cease labouring for the common good,
and Cicero, De Fin. iii. 19, says they
placed their force of character at the
service of mankind, and thought it
their duty to live, and if need were
to die, for the benefit of the public.</p></div>

 How, that is, can the stoic succeed
in destroying passions which
enter into the very composition of
man? The stoic made no such pretension.
What he laboured to "destroy"
were those "perturbations
of mind" which Zeno, Tusc. iv. 6,
maintained to be "repugnant to
reason, and against nature," and
for which the stoical remedy, Tusc.
iv. 28, was the demonstration that
they "were vicious, and had nothing
natural or necessary in them."
The principle for which Pope contended
was the very maxim of the
stoics,&mdash;they insisted that "reason
should keep to nature's road." The
real question was, whether they did
not sometimes go too far, and condemn
natural emotions under the
name of prohibited perturbations.</p></div>

Pope derived the notion from Mandeville,
who says that the diversity
of passions in different men "depend
only upon the different frame,&mdash;the
inward formation of either the solids
or the fluids." According to Pope
the strongest organ gives rise to some
passion of corresponding strength,
which finally absorbs all other passions.</p></div>

 He argues that our primitive tendencies
are too various to be steady.
Man is mercurial and fickle till his
numerous passions are lost in the
ruling passion, which converts our
changeable propensities into a single
desire. Under the government of reason
this "savage" and vicious "stock"
sends forth a healthy shoot of virtue
which is rendered strong and stable
by the vigour of the ruling passion,
or parent stem. The theory is wrong
throughout. People are not composed
of only one passion, virtue
cannot be the product of a vice, and
the simulated virtue which proceeds
from a solitary passion will be as
contracted as its cause. Pope's catalogue
of the ruling passions, and their
attendant virtues, exhibits a counterfeit
dismembered virtue,&mdash;a single
false limb in the place of a complete
and living body. An unmaimed virtue
requires the cultivation of our
nature in its complexity, and virtues
are grafted on lawful tendencies, and
not on lawless passions.</p></div>

 Pope probably alluded to Swift
when he spoke of the "crops of
wit and honesty" which were the
product of "spleen, obstinacy, and
hate." The spleen and hate engendered
wit by prompting satiric effusions;
but wit is not in itself a
virtue, and when Pope inserted it in
his catalogue he must have been
thinking of the moral ends it might
subserve.</p></div>

"Emulation," says Bishop Butler,
"is merely the desire of equality
with, or superiority over others, with
whom we compare ourselves. To
desire the attainment of this equality,
or superiority, by the particular
means of others being brought down
to our level, or below it, is, I think,
the distinct notion of envy." A
man who was made up of rivalry,
which is Pope's supposition, would
be an odious character, even without
the additional taint of envy, from
which, nevertheless, he could hardly
be free.</p></div>

 Pope speaks after Mandeville,
who says that shame and pride are
the "two passions in which the seeds
of most virtues are contained." Pride
he defined to be the faculty by which
men overvalued themselves, and were
led to do what would win them applause.
"There is not," he says,
"a duty to others or ourselves that
may not be counterfeited by it." No
quality, he admits, is more detested,
and it would defeat its own end if it
did not disguise itself in the garb of
virtue.</p></div>

 As Pope supposes shame to be
"a disease of the mind," he could
not apply the term to the self-reproaches
of an enlightened conscience,
but must mean the humiliation
produced by censure. This
species of shame can only bind us
to average decency of conduct, is
a feeble protection against secret vice,
and often an incentive to baseness.
Spurious shame, as Mandeville
remarks, induces women to murder
their illegitimate children, drives
many to tell falsehoods to conceal
their faults, changes with the company
and public opinion, and begets
a degrading compliance with the evil
habits of associates, and with the lax
customs of the age.</p></div>

Web may have been the General
Webb who got considerable reputation
for his defeat of the French at
Wynendale in 1708. Swift in his
Journal to Stella, April 19, 1711,
speaks of him as "going with a
crutch and a stick." Rancé was
born at Paris in 1626, and died
in 1700. In 1662 he assumed
the government of the monastery of
La Trappe, and was noted for the
austerities he imposed and practised.
Mr. Croker thinks that "B." who
"suffered for his prince" was Edward
Blount, the Roman Catholic Devonshire
squire. He went into voluntary
exile after the rebellion of 1715, but

 Catiline hemmed in by superior
forces died fighting with the courage
of despair. Unless he was greatly
maligned his conspiracies were
prompted by profligate selfishness
without any mixture of patriotism.
Decius, instructed by a vision on the
eve of the battle of Vesuvius, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
340, that the general on the one side,
and the army on the other was
doomed, rushed into the thick of the
fight to ensure by his own death the
destruction of the enemy. The story
of Decius may be fabulous, like that
of Pope's next example, Curtius, who
when informed, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 362, that a
chasm which had opened in the
Roman forum could never be filled
up till the basis of the Roman greatness
had been committed to it, was
alleged to have mounted on horseback
clad in armour, and to have leaped
into the gulf. Courage, the quality
common to Catiline, Decius, and
Curtius, is never a ruling passion, but
is the effect of some antecedent motive,
which may be vanity or duty,
lofty patriotism or criminal ambition.</p></div>

The idea expressed in the couplet is

Pope's meaning seems to be that in
all terrestrial things, except man,
extremes or contraries produce opposite
and uncompounded effects. In
man, extremes, in the shape of virtue
and vice, join and mix together. There
is no force in the distinction. Hot
water, for instance, mixes with cold,
and a mean temperature is the result.</p></div>

 "Great purposes," says Warburton
in explanation of this passage,
"are served by vice and virtue invading
each other's bounds, no less
than the perfecting the constitution
of the whole, as lights and shades, in
a well wrought picture, make the
harmony and spirit of the composition."
By this rule virtue dashed
with vice is more "spirited and harmonious"
than virtue without alloy.
Warburton allowed himself to be deluded
by a metaphor. Black paint
has no resemblance to black morals,&mdash;shadows
in a picture to hatred, avarice,

 The lines from ver. 207 to 214
are versified from Clarke's Evidences
of Natural and Revealed Religion,
10th ed., p. 184: "As in painting
two very different colours may, from
the highest intenseness in either extreme,
terminate in the midst insensibly,
so that it shall not be possible
to determine exactly where the one
ends, and the other begins, and yet
the colours may differ as much as can
be, not in degree only but in kind,
so, though it may, perhaps, be very
difficult in some nice cases to define
exactly the bounds of right and
wrong, yet right and wrong are totally
different, even altogether as much as
white and black, light and darkness."
The argument of Clarke was directed
against Hobbes, and his disciples,
who denied that there was any inherent
difference between good and evil,
and supported their paradox by pleading
the impossibility of drawing a
line between the two.</p></div>

Wicked but by degrees, or by surprise.

Of the last couplet there is a second
version:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Thus spite of all the Frenchman's witty lies<br />
Most vices are but virtues in disguise.
</div></div></div><p>

The witty Frenchman was La Rochefoucauld.
Pope's counter-maxim
is only a form of La Rochefoucald's
principle, converted into an apparent
contradiction by an equivocal
use of the phrase "virtues in
disguise." Those who pursue vicious
objects are reluctant to allow
that they are the slaves of vice.
"Hence," says Hutcheson, in a
passage quoted by Warton, "the
basest actions are dressed in some
tolerable mask. What others call
avarice, appears to the agent a prudent
care of a family or friends; fraud,
artful conduct; malice and revenge,
a just sense of honour; fire and sword
and desolation among enemies, a
just defence of our country; persecution,
a zeal for truth." Pope
assumes that the vice is inspired by
genuine virtue, whereas the virtue is
a pretence, a flimsy pretext to excuse
wrong-doing. The vice is real,
the virtue fictitious, and this is the
principle of La Rochefoucauld.</p></div>

 The word is inappropriate. Men
do not become sensual out of pity to
the miseries of sensuality, or envious
from compassion for the pangs of
envy. Pity may be felt for the evils
which vice entails, but this is not
pity for the vice, nor a temptation to
practise it.</p></div>

</div></div></div><p>

Sutton, Peter Walter, Hervey, Huggins,
Chartres, and Blunt will reappear
in connection with the offences for
which they are satirised here. Sid was
Lord Godophin, who was lampooned
under the name of Sid Hamet by
Swift. Pope, in his Moral Essays,
Epist. 1, ver. 86, speaks of his

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">
Newmarket fame, and judgment in a bet;
</span></p><p>

and the phrase, "Sid has the secret"
is an insinuation that his "judgment
in a bet" sometimes arose from his
being privy to the tricks of the turf.</p></div>

</div></div></div><p>

The agent of whom the Colonel complained
was the army agent. The
scrivener, who drew contracts, and
invested money, hated the attorneys
because they were in part competitors
for the same class of business. Boswell,
in his Life of Johnson, says,
that Mr. Ellis, who died in 1791,
aged 93, was the last of the scriveners.
Their occupation had gradually lapsed
to other professions, legal or monetary.
Pope's remaining instances are
forced. The attorney did not pay
more than his neighbours to the
county expenditure for prosecuting
thieves, and as the trials were much
to his own profit, he was the last person
who had an interest in inveighing
against thievery. As little did the
thief at his execution denounce "the
knaves of state," of whom he commonly
knew nothing. Pope has put
the satire of the Beggar's Opera into
the mouth of the veritable pick-pockets
and highwaymen.</p></div>

 Complete virtue, and complete
vice, says Pope, are both hostile to
self-interest, a plain confession that
his selfish system was incompatible
with thorough virtue. He assures
us, Epist. iv. ver. 310, that "virtue
alone is happiness below," but to be
consistent he must have meant virtue
seasoned with vice.</p></div>

 He is far from saying that good

usefully distributed to all orders of
men."</p></div>

The line is disfigured by the clumsy
transition from the present tense to

which is a trifle in comparison with
the doctrine that "heaven applies
happy frailties to all ranks." If the
"frailties" specified by Pope are
"happy," fear must be a recommendation
in a statesman, rashness in a
general, presumption in a king, and
a credulous faith in the presumption
the best condition for the people.</p></div>

 Men, says Pope, are reconciled
to death from growing weary of the
"wants, frailties, and passions" of life.
"The observation," says Warburton,
"is new, and would in any place be
extremely beautiful, but has here an
<i>infinite</i> grace and propriety." This is
one of the stock forms of Warburton's
adulation. Pope's remark was stale,
and from the nature of the case could
not be new if, as he asserted, it was
generally true, since all men in their
declining years could not, through all
time, have left unexpressed the feeling
which made them all willing to die.

The Duke of Argyle and General
Ross were both soldiers, both politicians,
and both Scotchmen. Ross
was a member of the House of
Commons. Toland introduced metaphysics
into his infidel works, and
Pope signifies by his couplet that the
inferior in a particular department
would not desire on the whole to
change characters with a superior in
the same department.</p></div>

 The "garters" refer to the badge
of the order of the garter. "Scarf,"
in the sense of a badge of honour,
was in Pope's day appropriated to the
nobleman's chaplain. "His sister,"
says Swift, speaking of a clerical
time-server in his Essay on the Fates
of Clergymen, "procured him a scarf
from my lord." Addison in the
Spectator, No. 21, compares bishops,
deans, and archdeacons to generals;
doctors of divinity, prebendaries, and
"all that wear scarves" to field-officers;
and the rest of the clergy
to subalterns. "There has been,"
he says, "a great exceeding of late
years in the second division, several
brevets having been granted for the
converting of subalterns into scarf-officers,
insomuch that within my
memory the price of lute-string"&mdash;the
material of which the scarf was
made&mdash;"is raised above twopence in
a yard." The number of chaplains a
nobleman could "qualify" varied
with his rank. A duke might nominate
six, a baron three. The distinction,
when Pope wrote his Essay,
was too slight to be fitly classed with
orders of knighthood.</p></div>

"Plastic," or as Bolingbroke called
it, "fashioning nature," was in its
etymological and popular sense, the
power in nature which gave things
their shape or figure. This seems to
be the meaning in Pope. The philosophic
sense of the phrase was more
extensive. The laws of matter may
have been made self-acting, or they
may be maintained by the direct
and constant interposition of God.
Cudworth, and some other writers,
who held the first of these opinions,
called "plastic nature" the inward
energy, the operative principle which
is as a sort of life to the laws. The
"plastic nature" of Cudworth is, in
reality, nothing more than the laws
of matter, with the proviso that they
work by an inherent virtue infused
into them by the Creator once for
all.</p></div>

 Pope is speaking in the context
of plants and animals, which are the
"they" of ver. 20. He threw ver.
18 into a parenthesis, and said, "<i>we</i>
catch," because the interjected remark
relates to men. The power displayed
in the transmission of life from
parents to progeny is happily illustrated
by Fénelon, in his Traité de
l'Existence de Dieu: "What should
we think of a watchmaker who could
make watches which would produce
other watches to infinity, insomuch
that the two first watches would be
sufficient to propagate and perpetuate
the species over all the earth? What
should we say of an architect who
had the art to construct houses which
generated fresh houses to replace our
dwellings before they began to fall
into ruin?"</p></div>

Pope copied Charron's predecessor,

why may not a goose say thus, 'The
earth serves me to walk upon, the
sun to light me. I am the darling
of nature. Is it not man that keeps,
lodges, and serves me? It is for
me that he both sows and grinds.'"
"The pampered goose," says Southey,
"must have been forgetful of plucking
time, as well as ignorant of the
rites that are celebrated in all old-fashioned
families on St. Michael's
Day." The goose's ignorance of his
future fate was part of Pope's argument,
and he contended that the men
who exclaimed, "See all things for
my use," were equally blind to the
purposes for which they were destined.
The illustration is poor both poetically
and philosophically.</p></div>

The superior mercy with which
Pope accredits men is of an unreflecting
description, since he implies
that it is regulated by gaiety of colour,
and sweetness of song, and not by
the capacities of creatures for pleasure
and pain. The claim itself is unfounded
under the circumstances of
his comparison. The falcon and the
jay must eat their natural prey or
starve, and when hunger or gratification
solicits him, man never hesitates
to kill the animals which are needful
for his support or delicious to his
palate. If he had a taste for
"insects with gilded wings," the
gilding on their wings would not
restrain him. Martial, Lib. xiii.
Ep. 70, says of the peacock, "You
admire him every time he displays
his jewelled wings, and can you,
hard-hearted man, deliver him to the
cruel cook?" and Pope in his celebrated
lines on the pheasant had
commemorated the impotence of
brilliant plumage to touch the compassion
of the sportsman. The poet,
in this Epistle, forgot that in Epist. i.
ver. 117, he had accused man
of "destroying all creatures for
his sport or gust," which is to
place him below the animals. He is
undoubtedly without an equal in his
destructive propensities, and too often
abuses his power over the sentient
world.</p></div>

 Pope repeats in this paragraph
the argument he uses Epist. i. ver.
77-98, to prove that death has been
beneficently disarmed of its terrors.
Unthinking animals cannot be troubled
at the prospect, for they have
no knowledge, he says, of their end,
which is more than we can tell; and
thinking beings, according to him,
have, in addition to the hope which
mingles with their dread, the unfailing
belief that death, though always
drawing nearer, is never near.
Such an irrational delusion in a
"thinking thing" is, in Pope's estimation,
a "standing miracle." The
ostensible miracle is deduced from
his exaggeration of the truth. The
conviction that death is distant
usually yields when appearances are
against the supposition. Hale men
often rush consciously upon certain
destruction; old and sick men have
constantly the genuine belief that
their end is at hand; and dying men
expect each day or hour to be their
last. The false expectation of prolonged
life does not enter into their
minds, and can have nothing to do
with their resignation, peace, or joy.</p></div>

 This is the true principle from
which Pope immediately departs, and
exalts instinct above reason. "Man,"
says Aristotle, "has sometimes more,
sometimes less than the beast;" for
they are adapted to different functions,
and man excels in his sphere,
and beasts in theirs. The sphere of
man is the highest, and his faculties
are proportionate. He cannot do the
work of the bee, but he can do his
own work, which is greater.</p></div>

 The roman catholic council, which
claims to be infallible. Instinct,
says Pope, being infallible does not
need the guidance of any other infallible
authority. When he speaks
of "full instinct," he probably means
that instinct is always complete within
its own limited domain, for if he
intended to put "full instinct" in
opposition to the instinct which is
defective and misleads, he would contradict
ver. 94, in which he states
that instinct "must go right."</p></div>

 In Pope's wide sense of the
term, reason adapts means to ends,
and distinguishes between truth
and falsehood, right and wrong. The
faculty operates in part spontaneously,
and in part with effort. In an endless
number of ordinary circumstances
man cannot help observing, comparing,
and inferring, and his reason
is itself an instinct which "comes a
volunteer." The distinction is, that
man does not stop with the unconstrained
exercise of his powers. He
aspires to progress, and laboriously
pushes forward, while animals turn
round, generation after generation, in
the same narrow circle. What Pope
supposed was a mark of man's inferiority
is just the ground of his
superiority. His conquests begin
with his difficulties and exertions.</p></div>

 Pope says, ver. 79, that whether
blessed with reason or instinct "all
enjoy the power that tends to bliss,&mdash;all
find the means proportioned
to the end." He now contradicts
himself with regard to reason, and
says that, in the effort to determine
which of our impulses are beneficial
and which injurious, it never hits
the mark, but labours in vain after
happiness. The wisdom he denies to
reason he erroneously ascribes to instinct,
which has no superiority
in securing an immunity from ill.
Through want of foresight, and the
limitation of their powers of contrivance,
myriads of creatures die of hunger
and cold. Those which come off with
life suffer frequently from scarcity and
inclement seasons. Their defective
sagacity makes them a prey to each
other and to man, and often when they
escape death they receive torturing
injuries. The young are exposed to
wholesale destruction, and in many
instances the parents manifest a grief
which if short is at least acute.
Creatures of the same species have
their intestine enmities, and engage
in combats attended by wounds and
death. They have their fears,
jealousies, and tempers, their alternations
of contentment and dissatisfaction,
and upon the whole the
instinct conferred upon animals seems
a less protection from present evils
than a moderate use of reason in man.
What alleviation there may be to
animals in their inevitable trials cannot
be known to us, but no one will
imagine that they can be supported
by sublimer hopes than our own.</p></div>

 This is a mistake. Instinct is
often imperfect with reference to its
own special ends. Misled by the
odour of the African carrion flower,
the flesh-flies lay their eggs in it, and
the progeny, not being vegetable
feeders, are starved. Here the injury
is to the offspring. In other cases
the erring individuals suffer for
their own mistake. Pope, in this
Epistle, magnifies instinct, and disparages
reason. In Epist. i., ver. 232,
he took the opposite side, and said
that the reason of man was all the
"powers" of animals "in one."</p></div>

 Addison, Spectator, No. 121;
"To me instinct seems the immediate
direction of Providence. A
modern philosopher delivers the same
opinion where he says, God himself
is the soul of brutes." Upon the
theory that brutes act from the
immediate impulse of their Maker,
there is a difficulty in explaining the
cases of misdirected instinct, as when
a jackdaw drops cart-loads of sticks
down a chimney, in the vain endeavour
to obtain a basis for its nest.
Some animals, again, profit by experience,
as foxes which improve in cunning,
and we must infer that the
assistance afforded by the Deity increases
with the experience of the
animals, though the experience is in
nowise concerned in the result. A
viciousness of temper, which resembles
the evil passions of men, sometimes
dominates in brutes, as we
may see in horses and dogs, and
we cannot ascribe these propensities
to the immediate instigation of the
Creator, unless we accept Pope's doctrine
that God "pours fierce ambition
into Cæsar's mind."</p></div>

 This instinct is not invariable.
Animals eat food poisoned artificially,
and sometimes feed greedily upon
poisonous natural products. Yew is
a poison to cows and horses, and yet
with an abundance of wholesome
herbage they will sometimes eat the
yew.</p></div>

 Every verb and epithet has here
a descriptive force. We find more
imagery from these lines to the end
of the Epistle, than in any other
parts of this Essay. The origin of
the connections in social life, the
account of the state of nature, the
rise and effects of superstition and
tyranny, and the restoration of true
religion and just government, all
these ought to be mentioned as passages
that deserve high applause,
nay, as some of the most exalted
pieces of English poetry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

 The halcyon or king-fisher was
reputed by the ancients "to build
upon the wave," and the entrance to
the floating nest was supposed to be
contrived in a manner to admit the
bird, and exclude the water of the
sea. Either Pope believed the fable,
or he thought himself at liberty to
illustrate the marvels of instinct by
fictitious examples. The couplet
was originally thus in the MS.:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
The cramp-fish, remora what secret charm<br />
To stop the bark, arrest the distant arm?
</div></div></div><p>

The cramp-fish is the torpedo. "She
has the quality," says Montaigne,
"not only to benumb all the members
that touch her, but even through
the nets transmits a heavy dullness
into the hands of those that move
them; nay, it is further said, that if
one pour water upon her, he will feel
this numbness mount up the water
to the hand, and stupify the feeling
through the water." The remora, or
sucking-fish, sticks by the disc on
the top of its head, to ships and other
fishes, and "renders immoveable,"
says Pliny, "the vessels which no
chain could stay, no weighty anchor
moor." The mighty prowess ascribed
to the remora is imaginary, and the
electrical capacity of the torpedo
greatly exaggerated. The story of
halcyon, cramp-fish, and remora are
all in Book ii. chap. 12 of Montaigne's
Essays.</p></div>

He was born in France in 1667.
Driven from his native country in

died there in 1754. He got his
living mainly by teaching mathematics,
in which his skill was consummate,

the subject attest the acuteness and
originality of his genius. He was

The squares than Gibbs, the bearings than Sir Kit.<br />
To poise his dome a martin has the knack,<br />
While bold Bernini lets St. Peter's crack.
</div></div></div><p>

Gibbs was born about 1674 and
died in 1754. He designed St.
Martin's church in London, and the
Radcliffe library at Oxford. Sir Kit
is Sir Christopher Wren. A century
after the dome of St. Peter's was
erected, Bernini inserted staircases
in the hollow piers which support the
cupola, and the cracks in the dome
were falsely ascribed to his operations.
The martins are not more
infallible than man, and, unlike man,
they do not profit by experience.
White of Selborne relates that they
built in the window corners of a
house in his neighbourhood, where
the recess was too shallow to protect
their work, which was washed down
with every hard rain, and yet year
after year they persevered through the
summer in their useless drudgery.</p></div>

 Ether was reputed to be an element
finer than air, and to fill the
regions beyond our atmosphere. Some
of the stoics believed that ether
was the animating principle of all
things, and Pope adopted the doctrine.
Hence he calls ether "all-quickening,"
and says that "one
nature feeds the vital flame" in all
the creatures of earth, air, and water.</p></div>

Dr. George Campbell remarks, in
his Philosophy of Rhetoric, that to
talk of creatures loving themselves
in their progeny is nonsensical rant.
Of many fathers and mothers it would
be nearer the truth to say that they
love their children almost to the
exclusion of themselves. Neither
Pope nor Bolingbroke had children,
and not having experienced, they
misapprehended, the parental feeling.</p></div>

 Pope's division of duties is not
the law of creation. In a multiplicity

equally abandons his defending function,

Reason, he says, teaches
man to improve on the ties of instinct,

his immediate family, whereby he at

"He speaks," says M. Crousaz,

ancient fable which he may have
read, among other places, in Montaigne's
Essays, Book ii. Chap. 12:
"Plato, in his picture of the golden
age under Saturn, reckons, among
the chief advantages that a man then

 "Her birth" is the birth of

 Oppian, Halicut. Lib. i., describes
this fish in the following manner:
"They swim on the surface of the
sea, on the back of their shells,
which exactly resemble the hulk of
a ship. They raise two feet like
masts, and extend a membrane between,
which serves as a sail; the
other two feet they employ as oars at
the side. They are usually seen in
the Mediterranean."&mdash;-<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p>
<p>
The paper-nautilus, or Argonauta
Argo, has eight arms. The first pair
in the female expand at their extremities,
so that each of the two arms
terminates in a broad thin membrane.
These broad membranes do not exist
in the male, and modern naturalists
reject the idea that they are used for
sails.</p></div>

 The imagery of the passage is
derived from an observation of a
Greek philosopher, who compared
laws to spiders' webs,&mdash;too fragile to
hold fast great offenders, and too
strong to suffer trivial culprits to
escape.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span>
</p>
<p>
Pope upbraids men for enacting
laws too strong for the weak instead
of following the laws of bees, which
are "wise as nature, and as fixed as
fate." Such is their superior consideration
for the weak that the
workers kill the drones when they
become burthensome to them, and so
far are we behind them in our poor
law legislation that we are compelled
to maintain the useless members of
society,&mdash;the old, the crippled, the
hopelessly sick, the insane, the idiotic&mdash;all
of whom, if we would only learn
mercy and wisdom of the bee, we
should immediately put to death.
The doctrine of Pope is altogether
childish. The contracted routine of
a bee's existence has too little in
common with the complicated relations
of human life for bee-hive
usages to displace the statutes of the
realm.</p></div>

<p>
The second line of the couplet had
already appeared in the Epistle of
Eloisa to Abelard, ver. 92, in connection
with sentiments which leave no
doubt of Pope's meaning. In the
primitive and golden age he held that
love had full liberty to obey its inclinations,
or, as he expressed it in the
passage of the MS. quoted by Warburton,
"beauty could then be kind
to all who loved." In other words
there was a community of women
regulated by no other law than natural
impulse.</p></div>

The nature of the distinction which
Pope draws between the lordship over
the early states, and kingly rule, is
clear from ver. 215, where he says
that till monarchy was established
patriarchal government prevailed, and
each state was only a collection of
relations who obeyed the family chief.
In a monarchy two or more states
were joined together, and the national
began to take the place of the family
tie. The effect of the change would
be great. The social bond between
the governor and the governed would
be weakened, and the official dignity,
the harsh authority, and selfish impulses
of the ruler would be quickly
increased.</p></div>

 "Sons," that is, "obeyed a
sire" on account of his "virtue,"
and not on account of his parental
authority. Pope had in his mind
the remarks of Locke. A mature
understanding is necessary for the
right direction of the will, and parents
must govern the will of the
child till he is competent to govern
his own. He is then responsible to
himself. He owes his parents lasting
honour, gratitude, and assistance,
but ceases to be under their command,
and if, in primitive times, the
children, who had arrived at years of
discretion, accepted a father for their
ruler, his "virtue," says Pope, was
the cause.</p></div>

language is that "virtue made
the father of a people a prince." He
was raised to be a prince because he
had manifested a fatherly care for the
people.</p></div>

 A finer example can perhaps
scarce be given of a compact and
comprehensive style. The manner in
which the four elements were subdued
is comprised in these four lines
alone. There is not an useless word
in this passage. There are but three
epithets,&mdash;"wond'ring, profound,
aerial"&mdash;and they are placed precisely
with the very substantive that is of
most consequence. If there had been
epithets joined with the other substantives,
it would have weakened
the nervousness of the sentence.
This was a secret of versification
Pope well understood, and hath often
practised with peculiar success.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Warton's criticism appears to be
wrong throughout. He says the lines
describe "the manner in which the
four elements were subdued;" but
we learn nothing of "the manner"
by being told that "fire" was "commanded,"
and water "controlled."
He says "there is not an useless
word;" but as either "command"
or "control" would apply with equal
propriety to both fire and water, the
second verb is added solely to eke
out the line, and the adjective "profound,"
when joined to "abyss," is
weak tautology for the sake of the
rhyme. He says that the epithets
"are placed precisely with the very
substantive that is of most consequence;"
but why is the "fire" less
important than the "abyss?" The
verses might pass without comment
if Warton had not extolled them for
imaginary merits. The first line is
an example of the sacrifice of truth
and picturesqueness to hyperbolical,
affected forms of speech. To talk of
"calling food from the wond'ring
furrow" conveys a false idea of agricultural
processes.</p></div>

 Men are said by the poet to have

At ver. 148 we are told that "the
state of nature was the reign of God,"
and at ver. 156 that "all vocal beings"&mdash;man,
bird, and beast&mdash;joined then
in "hymning" their Creator. This
condition of things, we learn from
ver. 149, dated from the "birth" of
nature, which is contrary to Pope's
present conjecture that the primitive
families may, perhaps, have had no
conception of a Deity. The poet's
language is irrational. If God did not
reveal himself to them in any direct
way, they might yet be supposed capable
of inferring from their own existence
and that of the universe, a truth
which their posterity deduced from
the death of patriarch after patriarch.</p></div>

 Pope ought to have written "began."

 The divine right of kings to their
throne, and the unlawfulness of deposing
them, however much they
might oppress the people for whose
benefit they were appointed to rule,
was a doctrine first taught in the
time of the Stuarts. "It was never
heard of among mankind," says Locke
writing in 1690, "till it was revealed
to us by the divinity of this last
age." In opposition to the slavish
theory which would subject nations
to despots, Pope says that when government
was instituted allegiance
was the voluntary homage of love.</p></div>

 Mr. Pope told us that of the
number that had read these Epistles,
he knew of no one that took the elegance,
or even the true meaning of
the word "enormous," except Lord
Bolingbroke alone. I wonder at it. I
am sure I never understood it otherwise
than as "out of all rule," and I do
not know how anybody could that had
read Horace's "abnormis sapiens,"
and Milton's "enormous bliss." Mr.
Pope added for that reason, against
his rule of brevity, the two next lines
to explain it, and accordingly I since
saw them interlined in the original
MS.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span>
</p>
<p>
Milton's "enormous bliss" was
bliss "wild, above rule or art." The
persons who misunderstood the epithet
in Pope's poem must have been those
who read the MS.; for the explanatory
couplet appeared in the first
edition of the Epistle. He obviously
meant by "enormous faith" that the
faith was an enormity, and it is difficult
to conjecture what other sense
could be attached to his phrase.</p></div>

Wakefield remarks that Pope followed
Pythagoras in calling food "living,"
because it had once been alive. A
meat diet is said, ver. 167, to have
been the origin of wars, and here we
are told that the "flamen first tasted
living food" after war and tyranny
had over-spread the earth, which is
an inconsistency, unless Pope believed
that his "glutton priests" were more
abstemious than the rest of mankind
till animals were sacrificed in the name
of religion. The poet, in this Epistle,
is loud in denouncing the practice
of eating animal food, but he ate it

Many of Pope's writings are strewed

 Hooker, Eccles. Polity, bk. i.
chap. x. sect. 5: "At the first, it
may be, that all was permitted unto

The lines were intended to give the
reason why law is not an infringement
of liberty, and were probably cancelled
because the reason was as applicable
to cruel as to salutary laws. Upon
Pope's principle the worst despotism
would not interfere with the liberty
of the subject, provided only that
resistance was hopeless.</p></div>

 The inspired strains of the Hebrew
Scriptures are the only instance
in which poetry has "restored faith
and morals." The heathen poets
adopted the absurd and profligate
fables current in their day, and
christian poets have never done more
than reflect the prevalent christianity.
The term "patriot" is commonly applied
to political benefactors, and not
to the preachers and disseminators of
righteousness. Pope fell back on the
fiction of regenerating poets and patriots
to avoid all mention of the
saints and martyrs who really performed
the mighty work. Bolingbroke
hated the apostles of genuine religion,
and his pupil had no reverence for
them.</p></div>

The position is demonstrably absurd
in both poets. All conduct originates
in principles. Where the principles,
therefore, are not strictly pure, and
accurately true, the conduct must
deviate from the line of perfect rectitude.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span>

<p>
"I prefer a bad action to a bad
principle," says Rousseau, somewhere,
and Rousseau was right. A bad
action may remain isolated; a bad
principle is always prolific, because,
after all, it is the mind which governs,
and man acts according to his thoughts
much oftener than he himself imagines.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guizot.</span>
</p>
<p>
He whose life is in the right cannot,
says Pope, in any sense calling
for blame, have a wrong faith. But
the answer is that his life cannot be
in the right unless in so far as it
bends to the influences of a true
faith. How feeble a conception must
that man have of the infinity which
lurks in a human spirit, who can
persuade himself that its total capacities
of life are exhaustible by the
few gross acts incident to social relations,
or open to human valuation?
The true internal acts of moral man
are his thoughts, his yearnings, his
aspirations, his sympathies or repulsions
of heart. This is the life of
man as it is appreciable by heavenly
eyes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">De Quincey.</span></p></div>

 Happiness is with Pope the sole
end of life, and virtue is only a
means. The means cannot be more
binding than the end, and happiness
is not obligatory and virtue
is. A certain contempt, again, for
pain and privation is heroic, but indifference
to moral worth is degradation.
Thus virtue is plainly an end
in itself, and is superior, not subordinate,
to happiness.</p></div>

 Pope personified happiness at the
beginning, but seems to have dropped
that idea in the seventh line, where
the deity is suddenly transformed
into a plant, from whence this metaphor

happiness again as a person, in the
eighteenth line.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>

A sentence in Hooker's Eccl. Pol.,
Book i. Chap. viii. Sect. 7, will explain
Pope's idea in the last four lines:

I look to have any part of my desire
satisfied, unless myself be careful to
satisfy the like desire in other men?"</p></div>

 "Sincere" in its present use is
the opposite of "disingenuous," "deceptive,"
and has always a moral
signification. Formerly it had the
sense, which Pope gives it here, of
"pure," "unadulterated," without
any necessary ethical meaning. Thus
Dryden, Palamon and Arcite, Bk. iii.

</p><p><span class="fnpoetry">

"Quæ maxima Epicure felicitas videtur,
nihil agit." The poet's account

of placing "bliss in ease" they
inculcated the sternest self-denial,
and untiring efforts to fulfil all virtue.</p></div>

<p>
The true stoic did not, as Pope

contended that it was all-sufficient.
Till the edition of 1743 this couplet
was as follows:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>
<p>
The two lines which conclude the
paragraph, and which first appeared
in the edition of 1743, were written
at Warburton's suggestion. The
object of the addition was to represent
the credulous man who
trusted everything as equally deceived
with the sceptic who trusted
in nothing. Of the last line there is
a second version:

Pyrrho and his followers held that
we can only know things as they appear,

they maintained that appearances

that we could be equally happy in all
conditions,&mdash;in sickness, for instance,
Cicero, Fin. ii. 13, as in health. The
one reality which Pyrrho admitted
was virtue, and this he said (Cicero,
Fin. iv. 16), was the supreme good
which he who possessed had nothing

 Pope's complaint, that the directions
of the ancient moralists amounted
to no more than that "happiness is
happiness," arose from his ignorance
of their tenets. The stoics and sceptics
placed the supreme good in unconditional
virtue, and the epicureans
taught the precise doctrine of Pope
himself, that pleasure is the goal, and
virtue the road. The admonition,
"take nature's path," which Pope
would substitute for the teaching of
these sects, was the maxim on which
they all insisted.</p></div>

The man who always "thinks
right" is infallible in wisdom, and if
he always "means well" he must act
in obedience to his infallible convictions,
when he will also be impeccable.
There needs but this, says Pope, to
secure happiness. He scoffs at the
vague definitions of philosophers, and
substitutes the luminous direction
that we should be infallible in our
views, and impeccable in our conduct.</p></div>

"Good" and "wisdom" in the last

something that was not true wisdom
and goodness if Pope had not argued,
ver. 259-268, that real wisdom was injurious
to happiness. He would have
the "right thinking" alloyed with

"Heaven's just balance" is
made "equal," says this writer,
because men are harassed with fears
in proportion to their elevation, and
amused with hopes in a state of distress.
But a man may be good either
in high or low rank; and God does
not, to make the happiness of mankind

idle fears, and of the other with chimerical
hopes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Crousaz.</span></p></div>

The Arbuthnot mentioned here was
Charles, a clergyman, and son of the
celebrated physician. His death in
1732 was supposed to have been
occasioned by the lingering effects of
a wound he received in a duel he
fought while at Oxford with a fellow-collegian,
his rival in love. James
Craggs died of the small-pox Feb. 14,
1721, aged 35. Virtue had certainly
no share in his death, for he was
licentious in private life, and in his
public capacity accepted a bribe from
the South Sea directors. Walsh died
in 1708, at the age of 49. His virtue
may be estimated by his confession
that he had committed every folly in
love, except matrimony. Lady Scudamore,
widow of Sir James Scudamore,
and daughter of the fourth
Lord Digby, died of the small-pox,
May 3, 1729, aged 44. She left only
a daughter, who married, and hence
Pope's expression, "Scud'more ends
her name." The many Digbys
united in one grave were the children
of the fifth Lord, the father of the
poet's friend, Robert. I do not
know what is meant by the "fierce
love" which was Falkland's "doom,"
nor can I identify the Louisa who
died of grief.</p></div>

Pope's mother died June 7, 1733.
She was said by the poet to be 93,
but was only 91, if the register of

the case, since an elder sister was

 How change can admit, or nature
let fall any evil, however short and
rare it may be, under the government
of an all-wise, powerful, and benevolent
Creator, is hardly to be understood.
These six lines are perhaps
the most exceptionable in the whole
poem in point both of sentiment and
expression.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p>
<p>
Pope's justification of the partial
ill which is not a general good is,
in substance, that Providence has
not supreme dominion over his
physical laws, that change and
nature act independently of him,
and vitiate his work. In place of
ver. 113-16 the earlier editions have
this couplet:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
God sends not ill, 'tis nature lets it fall,<br />
Or chance escape, and man improves it all.<br />
</div></div></div>
<p>
The notion that the disturbing
operations of "chance" could explain
the existence of evil was intrinsically
absurd, and inconsistent with Ep. i.,
ver. 290, where Pope says that "all
chance is direction." Chance is,
in strictness, a nonentity, and
merely signifies that the cause of
an effect is unknown to us, or
beyond our control. Neither supposition
could apply to the Almighty.
Warburton quotes a couplet from
the MS., which could not be retained
without a glaring contradiction, when
Pope had discovered two other evil-doers
besides man,&mdash;nature and
chance:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

 Warburton says that Pope alluded
to Empedocles. The story ran that
he pretended to be a divinity, and
threw himself into the crater of Ætna,
that nobody might know what had
become of him, and might conclude
that he had been carried up into
heaven. All the circumstances of his
death are doubtful, and whether he
was a calumniated sage, or a conceited
madman, legends are not a
proper illustration of God's dealings
with mankind. Pope had originally
written,</p>

Pliny, the naturalist, was commanding

Naples. He made for the coast in
the neighbourhood of the volcano,
till checked by the falling stones and
ashes, he sailed to Stabiæ, and landed.
In a few hours the tottering of the
houses, shaken by the earthquake,
warned him to fly, and according to
his nephew he was overtaken by
flames and sulphurous vapours, and
suffocated. Stabiæ is ten miles from
Vesuvius, and the flame and vapour

a quotation from a letter of Pope's
to Bethel, "then in Italy," and we
may conclude that Bethel, being
troubled with an asthma, visited
Italy for relief, but that in crossing

 Bolingbroke, Fragment 57:
"Christian divines complain that
good men are often unhappy, and
bad men happy. They establish a
rule, and are not agreed about the
application of it; for who are to
be reputed good christians? Go
to Rome, they are papists. Go to
Geneva, they are calvinists. If particular
providences are favourable to
those of your communion they will be
deemed unjust by every good protestant,
and God will be taxed with
encouraging idolatry and superstition.
If they are favourable to those
of any of our communions they will
be deemed unjust by every good papist,
and God will be taxed with
nursing up heresy and schism."</p></div>

"If," says Pope, "the world is
made for ambitious men, such as
Cæsar, it is also made for good men,
like Titus." Extreme cases test principles,
and to establish his position,
that the virtuous in this life have
always a larger share of enjoyments
than the worldly, Pope should have
dealt with some of the numerous instances
in which the good have been
condemned to tortures in consequence
of their goodness.</p></div>

 Unquestionably it must be one of
the rewards if Pope is right in maintaining
that present happiness is proportioned
to virtue. No more cruel

act on his doctrine, and tell a virtuous
mother, surrounded by starving
children, that she and her little ones
were quite as happy as the families
who lived in abundance.</p></div>

Ver. 162 in the text is inconsistent

From Warton's note it would appear

 No rational believer in Providence
ever did suppose that to have
less than a thousand a year was a
mark of God's hatred, or ever doubted
that the sufferings of good men in
this life were consistent with the dispensations
of wisdom and mercy.
Pope began by undertaking to prove
that happiness was independent of
externals, and drops into the separate
and indubitable proposition that
earthly happiness and the blessing of
God are not dependent upon the possession
of a thousand a year.</p></div>

 Pope took the phrase from Mandeville,
Fable of the Bees, vol. i.,
p. 26: "Who can forbear laughing
when he thinks on all the great men
that have been so serious on the
subject of that Macedonian madman?"
Warton protests against the
application of the term to Alexander
the Great, and adds that Charles XII.
of Sweden "deserved not to be
joined with him." The objection is
well-founded, for Pope not only compared
them in their rage for war, but
said that neither "looked further
than his nose," which was true of
Charles XII., and false of Alexander,
who mingled grand schemes of civilisation
with his selfish lust of dominion.</p></div>

 "To find an enemy of all mankind,"
signifies to find some one who
is an enemy of all mankind, whereas
Pope means to say that heroes desire
to find all mankind their enemies. He
exaggerated the "strangeness" of the
conqueror's "purpose." The making
enemies is incidental to the purpose,

 The pronunciation of "great"
was not uniform in Pope's day.
"When I published," says Johnson,
"the plan for my Dictionary, Lord
Chesterfield told me that the word
'great' should be pronounced so as
to rhyme to 'state,' and Sir William
Yonge sent me word that it should
be pronounced so as to rhyme to
'seat,' and that none but an Irishman
would pronounce it 'grait.'" Pope,
in this epistle, and elsewhere, has
made "great" rhyme to both sounds.</p></div>

 Marcus Aurelius, who regulated
his life by the lofty principles of the
Stoics, was born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 121 and died
180. The man, says Pope, who aims
at noble ends by noble means is
great, whether he attains his end or
fails, whether he reigns like Aurelius
or perishes like Socrates.</p></div>

 The "wit" is not to be taken
here in its narrow modern sense of a
jester. Pope is deriding fame in
general, and divides famous men into

and Newton, are compared to feathers,
which are flimsy and showy; and
the heroes, who are the scourges of

 Marcellus was an opponent of
Cæsar, and a partisan of Pompey.
After the battle of Pharsalia he retired
to Mitylene, was pardoned by
Cæsar at the request of the senate,
and assassinated by an attendant on
his way back to Rome. His moral
superiority over Cæsar is conjecture.
Warton mentions that "by Marcellus
Pope was said to mean the
Duke of Ormond," a man of small
abilities, and a tool of Bolingbroke
and Oxford. He fled from England
at the death of Queen Anne, joined
the court of the Pretender, and being
attainted had to pass the rest of his
life abroad. He died at Madrid,
Nov. 16, 1745, aged 94. One version
of the couplet in the MS. has the
names of Walpole, and the jacobite
member of parliament, Shippen:</p>

 Pope objects that wise men
are "condemned to drudge," which
is not an evil peculiar to the
tasks of wise men, and so immensely
does the pleasure of mental
exercise preponderate over the weariness,
that a taste for philosophy,
letters, and science is one of the
surest preservatives against the tedium
of life. He objects that the wise
have no one to second or judge them
rightly, which never happens. The
most neglected genius wins disciples
from the beginning, who make up in
weight what they want in number,
and were the adherents fewer, the
capacity which conceives important
truths would be self-sustained from
the consciousness that truth is mighty
and will prevail.</p></div>

 The allusion is to Bolingbroke's
patriotic pretensions, and political

was too transparent.</p></div>

 To a person that was praising

"I borrowed the whole from ten

 This line is inconsistent with
ver. 261-2. A man who feels painfully
his own ignorance and faults is
not "above life's weakness." The
line is also inconsistent with ver. 310.
No one can be above life's weakness
who is not transcendent in
virtue, and then he cannot be above
"life's comfort," since Pope says,
that "virtue alone is happiness
below." The melancholy picture,
again, which the passage presents
of the species of martyrdom endured
by Bolingbroke from his intellectual
pre-eminence, is inconsistent with
ver. 18, where Pope says that perfect
happiness has fled from kings
to dwell with St. John.</p></div>

 Lord Umbra may have stood for
a dozen insignificant peers who had
the ribbon of some order. Sir Billy
was Sir William Yonge, who was
made a Knight of the Bath when the
order was revived in May, 1725.
"Without having done anything,"
says Lord Hervey, "out of the common
track of a ductile courtier, and
a parliamentary tool, his name was
proverbially used to express everything
pitiful, corrupt, and contemptible."
His one talent was a
fluency which sounded like eloquence,
and meant nothing, and this ready
flow of specious language, unaccompanied
by solid reasoning or conviction,
and always exerted on behalf of
his patron, Walpole, rendered his unconditional

 Mr. Croker asks "who was
happy to ruin and betray?&mdash;the
favourite or the sovereign?" The
language is confused, but "their" in
the next line refers to those who
"ruin" and "betray," and shows that
the favourites were meant. They
were happy to ruin those&mdash;the kings,
to betray these&mdash;the queens. The
couplet made part of the attack upon
the Duke of Marlborough, and the
words of ver. 290 were borrowed from
Burnet, who said in his defence of
the Duke, "that he was in no contrivance
to ruin or betray" James II.
While, however, he was a trusted
officer in the army of James he
entered into a secret league with the
Prince of Orange, and deserted to
him on his landing. The accusation
of lying in the arms of a queen, and
afterwards betraying her, alludes,
says Wakefield, to Marlborough's
youthful intrigue with the Duchess
of Cleveland, the mistress of
Charles II., and we need not reject
the interpretation because the mistress
of a king is not a queen, or
because there is no ground for believing
that Marlborough betrayed
her. Pope constantly sacrificed accuracy
of language to glitter of style,
and historic truth to satirical venom.</p></div>

 This couplet and the next have a
view to his supposed peculation as
commander-in-chief, and his prolongation
of the war on this account.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span>
</p>
<p>
The charges were the calumnies of
an infuriated faction. His military
career while he was commander-in-chief
was free from reproach. He
was never known to sanction an act
of wanton harshness, or to exceed the
recognised usages of war. The pretence
that he prolonged the contest
for the sake of gain does not require
a refutation, for his accusers could
never produce a fragment of colourable
evidence in support of the allegation.
The Duke of Wellington ridiculed
the notion, and said that
however much Marlborough might
have loved money he must have
loved his military reputation more.
The poet, who denounced him as a
man "stained with blood," and
"infamous for plundered provinces,"
could, at ver. 100, call Turenne
"god-like," though he gave
the atrocious command to pillage and
burn the Palatinate, and turned it
into a smouldering desert. "Habit,"
says Sismondi, "had rendered him
insensible to the sufferings of the
people, and he subjected them to the
most cruel inflictions."</p></div>

affords happiness which infringes

vanities. Or he may mean that
virtue is by itself complete happiness,
whatever else may be our circumstances,

gain," and yet "no pain to lose,"
since the annihilated will not be conscious
of the loss. Lord Byron expressed
the same idea in a letter,
Dec 8, 1821: "Indisputably, the
believers in the gospel have a
advantage over all others,&mdash;for
this simple reason, that, if true,
they will have their reward hereafter, and
if there be no hereafter, they can be
but with the infidel in his eternal
sleep, having had the assistance of an
exalted hope through life." Pope
and Byron leave out of their reckoning
the sufferings to which christians
are constantly exposed through their
homage to christianity.</p></div>

 Is it so impossible that a "wish"
should "remain" when Pope has
just said that virtue is "never elated
while one oppressed man" exists?
Or has virtue in tears, ver. 320, no
wish for that happiness which Pope
says, ver. 1, is "our being's end and
aim?" Or is the "wish" for "more
virtue" fulfilled by the act of wishing,
without frequent failure, and perpetual

In his second epistle Pope maintains
that we are born with the germ
of an unalterable ruling passion
which grows with our growth, and
swallows up every other passion.
Among these ruling passions he
specifies spleen, hate, fear, anger,
etc., which are dispensed by fate,
absorb the entire man, and of necessity
exclude love. Here, on the
contrary, we are told, ver. 327-340,
that "the sole bliss heaven could
on <i>all</i> bestow," is the virtue which
"ends in love of God and love of
man."</p></div>

 The meaning of this couplet
comes out clearer in the prose explanation
which Pope has written on
his MS.: "God implants a desire of
immortality, which at least proves
he would have us think of, and
expect it, and he gives no appetite
in vain to any creature. As God
plainly gave this hope, or instinct, it
is plain man should entertain it.
Hence flows his greatest hope, and
greatest incentive to virtue."</p></div>

 Pope exalts the duty of "benevolence,"
which, ver. 371, causes
"earth to smile with boundless
bounty blessed." But bounty cannot
benefit the recipients, if the poet is

is independent of externals.</p></div>

 Pope professes to believe that all
his poetry up to the Essay on Man
was made up of "sounds" to the
exclusion of "things," and was addressed
as little "to the heart" as
to the understanding. His change of
subject, and his panegyrics on virtue,
had at least not taught him that the
manly simplicity of truth was to be
preferred to insincere hyperboles.</p></div>

 Archbishop Whately, Bacon's
Essays, p. 145, quotes this stanza,
and says that it is strange that Pope,
and those who use similar language,
should have "failed to perceive that
the pagan nations were in reality
atheists. For by the word God we
understand an Eternal Being, who
made and who governs all things.
And so far were the ancient pagans
from believing that 'in the beginning
God made the heavens and the earth,'
that, on the contrary, the heavens,
and the earth, and the sea, and many
other natural objects, were among
the very gods they adored. Accordingly,
the apostle Paul expressly
calls the ancient pagans, atheists,
Ephes. ii. 12, though he well knew
that they worshipped certain supposed
superior beings which they
called gods. But he says in the
Epistle to the Romans that 'they
worshipped the creature more than,
that is, instead of the Creator.' And
at Lystra, when the people were going
to do sacrifice to him and Barnabas,
mistaking them for two of their gods,
he told them to 'turn from those
vanities to serve the living God, who
made heaven and earth.'" The
pagans were equally ignorant of the
holiness of the Supreme Being; and
Pope himself, describing the heathen
divinities, Essay on Man, Epist. iii.
257, calls them</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">
Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,<br />
Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust.<br />
</div></div></div>
<p>
Such a divinity was Jupiter, and
to worship an abominable phantom,
conspicuous for "rage, revenge,
and lust," was not to adore
"Jehovah."</p></div>

 This may mean that the Deity
was beneficent, or holy, or both, but
whatever sense Pope attached to the
word, he held with Bolingbroke that
the attributes of the Divine Being
were not the qualities which passed
by the same name among us, and the
present stanza is a re-assertion of
the doctrine of the Essay on Man,
Epist. ii. 1, that we must not "presume
to scan God," or think to know
more than the bare fact that he is
"good."</p></div>

Here followed, if it is genuine, a
suppressed stanza, which Mrs. Thrale
repeated to Dr. Johnson, and which
she said a clergyman of their acquaintance
had discovered:</p>
<div class="fnpoetry-container"><div class="fnpoetry"><div class="stanza">

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which nature's self inspires</span>
</div></div></div><p>

Mrs. Thrale called the stanza "licentious,"
Johnson observed that it
was borrowed from the Pastor Fido
of Guarini, and Boswell pointed out
that a "rod of fires" was an incongruous
metaphor. "I warrant you,
however," said Johnson, "Pope wrote
this stanza, and some friend struck
it out." The folly of the lines is
transparent. The "sins" with
which "nature's self inspires" man,
"conscience warns him not to do,"
ver. 14, and Pope assumes that
God will never be "offended" if
we disregard conscience, and yield to
temptation.</p></div>

 Unquestionably no man of right

Nothing can be more false than the

affects to conceive that man is answerable
only for the sincerity of his

 Erudition and acuteness are not the only requisites of a good commentator. That
conformity of sentiment which enables him fully to enter into the intention of his author,
and that fairness of disposition which places him above every wish of disguising or misrepresenting
it, are qualifications not less essential. In these points it is no breach of candour
to affirm, since the public voice has awarded the sentence, that Dr. Warburton has,
in various of his critical labours, shown himself extremely defective, and perhaps in none
more than in those he has expended upon this performance, his manifest purposes in
which, have been to give it a systematic perfection that it does not possess, to conceal as
much as possible the suspicious source whence the author derived his leading ideas, and
to reduce the whole to the standard of moral orthodoxy. So much is the sense of the poet
strained and warped by these processes of his commentator, that it is scarcely possible in
many places to enter into his real meaning, without laying aside the commentary, and
letting the text speak for itself&mdash;<span class="smcap">Aikin.</span></p></div>

 All three were republicans who flourished at the period of the Great Rebellion.
Harrington published his political work, Oceana, in 1656, and Neville his Plato Redivivus,
or A Dialogue concerning Government, in 1681. Burnet says of Wildman that he
"had been a constant meddler on all occasions in everything that looked like sedition,
and seemed inclined to oppose everything that was uppermost." He served in the
Parliamentary army, and proved troublesome to Cromwell, who imprisoned him. His
restless republicanism was thought dangerous at the Restoration, and the government
kept him under lock and key for some years. He survived to take a share in the
Revolution of 1688, and was as hard to please as in his younger days. Pepys says in 1667,
that he had been "a false fellow to everybody."</p></div>

 A false pretence. Waterland expressed his disapproval of Warburton's Divine
Legation, and Jackson wrote a formal refutation. Warburton, as sensitive as he was
abusive, never forgave them, and to revenge his wounded vanity, he thrust this forced
digression into the middle of Pope's works under the hollow plea that Pope seemed to
have had in his mind the controversy between Jackson and Waterland on the Trinity.
Jackson was an Arian clergyman, who defended the views of Samuel Clarke.</p></div>

 Tindal, who was a deist, published in 1730 his well-known work, Christianity as old
as the Creation. Waterland wrote an answer called Scripture Vindicated, and Jackson,
his Remarks on a book entitled, etc.</p></div>

 Waterland published a sermon called, A familiar discourse upon the doctrine of the
Holy Trinity, and the use and importance of it; and Jackson, after publishing in 1734
his treatise On the Existence and Unity of God, followed it up in 1735, with A Defence of
the book entitled, On the Existence, etc., in answer to Law's Enquiry into the Ideas of
Space, Time, etc. Warburton, in his discreditable note, has not the candour to allude to
the real ground of his rancour against Jackson and Waterland.

 of sublimity, all of
which, as Dr. Warton observes, prove the
 contrary.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.

<div class='transnote'><h3>Transcriber's Notes:</h3>

<p>
1. Except as noted below, obvious punctuation inconsistencies and
typographical errors and spelling errors have been corrected.
</p><p>
2. Except as noted below, spelling and capitalization inconsistencies
have been retained.
</p><p>
3. Pope often wrote names with dashes replacing part of the name, as
in 'Sw--y'.  The dashes look like em-dashes in the original, but they
have been changed to long dashes; thus, 'Sw----y'.
</p>


<p>
4. On <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>, the first
footnote (<a href="#Footnote_195_195">footnote 195</a>)
('This couplet is succeeded by
two...') has nothing in the text pointing to it; however the
 <a href="#So_much_they_scorn">couplet</a> on lines 426 and 427
 is marked in pen at the side. This could be the
couplet referred to in footnote 195.
</p><p>
5. On <a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>, the second footnote
 (<a href="#Footnote_318_318">footnote 318</a>) ('Spence, p. 178.') has
nothing in the text pointing to it; however it seems likely that it
refers to the <a href="#He_has_an_appetite">quote</a> ending 'He has an appetite to satire.'
</p><p>
6. On <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>, 'terrestial' (in
the <a href="#Whose_shapes_seemed_not">phrase </a>'Whose shapes seemed not like to
terrestial boys,') was changed to 'terrestrial'.
</p><p>
7. On the unnumbered <a href="#Unnumbered_page_145">page</a>
between p. 144 and p. 146, the line in the
third footnote (<a href="#Footnote_369_369">footnote 369</a>),
 'If any muse assists the poet's lays'
had 'asists' in the original.
</p><p>
8. On
<a href="#Page_146">p. 146</a>, in the fourth footnote
(<a href="#Footnote_375_375">footnote 375</a>)
 the <a href="#I_myself_about_the">phrase</a>
 'I myself, about the year 1790' was 'I
myself, about the year year 1790' in the original.
</p><p>
9. On the unnumbered <a href="#Unnumbered_page_185">page</a>
 before p. 186, the
<a href="#Launched_on_the_bosom">line</a> 'Launched on the bosom of the silver Thames'
 had 'bosm' in the original.

10. On <a href="#Page_231">p. 231</a>, the third footnote
 (<a href="#Footnote_576_576">footnote 576</a>)
 ('Introduction to the
Literature of Europe, 5th ed. vol. i. p. 33....') has nothing in the
text pointing to it.
</p><p>
11. On <a href="#Page_254">p. 254</a>,
 the first footnote (<a href="#Footnote_697_697">footnote 697</a>)
 ('The combination
"heavenly-fair"...') had nothing in the text pointing to it; a
pointer
 has
been added after the first line on the page, which starts 'Oh grace
serene!'
</p><p>
12. On <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>, in the
<a href="#With_these_precautions_in">phrase</a>
 'With these precautions, in 1732[3] was
published...', the '[3]' does not indicate a footnote. Other footnote
indicators in the original were superscripts; this '[3]' was not.
</p><p>
13. On <a href="#Page_274">p. 274</a>, the
<a href="#Beforehand">word</a> 'beforehand' was broken
across two lines; it
 was arbitrarily made 'beforehand' rather than 'before-hand'.
</p><p>
14. On <a href="#Page_388">p. 388</a>, the
<a href="#Through_life_tis_followed">line</a>
 'Through life 'tis followed, ev'en at life's expense'
 had 'expence' in the original.

15. On <a href="#Page_513">p. 513</a>, the
<a href="#He_subdued_the_intractability">phrase</a>
 'He subdued the intractability
